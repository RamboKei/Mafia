"challengeDesc1":"You're on your way home, proud and excited with tons of achievements under your belt, when you run straight into your nemesis...",
"challengeDesc2":"Zhao Hu (position: Minister of Prison, Rank 9) is violating imperial laws by harassing innocent civilian girls in front of the mansion belonging to you, the new Top Talent who got first place in the Imperial Exams. You arrest that scoundrel then and there. ",
"challengeDesc3":"The next day, you arrive at the mansion of Zhao Qun (position: Minister of Morning Rituals, Rank 9). Your meet up with your elder sister and arrest Zhao Qun.",
"challengeDesc4":"Seizing Zhao Qun and saving the people in the dungeons of Zhao's house was a good thing for singing praise. Never thought that you would receive a threat letter after returning home.",
"challengeDesc5":"A drought has plagued the Jianghuai area, making it difficult for peasants to get anything to grow. You decide it's time to ask Tang Bohu for help...",
"challengeDesc6":"Liu Gen (position: Village Chief, Rank 9 +) wishes to hog all the relief supplies for himself. Su Qi'er is the only one who stands between the greedy Chief's men and the welfare of the civilians!",
"challengeDesc7":"Su Qi'er puts his life on the line to ship the rations back to the village. You assemble the villagers and distribute the food to them all.",
"challengeDesc8":"You order Yuan Fang to make recruitment posters to seek warriors to join you. Yet before you manage to find anyone suitable, your nemesis has already sent someone to assassinate you...",
"challengeDesc9":"You finally come to in your own bed. After learning about what went down, you immediately send your men to seek Shan Ji's whereabouts. Su Qi'er is able to locate him the very next day, and you head over to express your gratitude.",
"challengeDesc10":"It turns out that, after saving your life, Shan Ji (position: Guard Captain, Rank 8) has set off to the County Hall to discuss affairs regarding your safety with Feng Yuntian (position: County Minister, Rank 8 +).",
"challengeDesc11":"After Shan Ji explains what occurred to Feng Yuntian, the latter agrees to protect you, the newly crowned Top Talent in the Imperial Exams.",
"challengeDesc12":"After visiting the Zhao mansion multiple times, you finally have the honor of meeting the chivalrous knight-errant Sir Zhao. You present him the sword you forged especially for him as a gift.",
"challengeDesc13":"Shan Ji (position: Guard Captain, Rank 8) invites you to his mansion and explains to you his relation to Qian De (position: Guard Commander, Rank 8). You're not the only one who is shocked!",
"challengeDesc14":"You decide to become sworn brothers with Shan Ji. Not soon after, you receive an invitation to the 80th Birthday Party of Qian De's mother.",
"challengeDesc15":"Shan Ji discusses this with you, and your ideas regarding the situation impress him greatly.",
"challengeDesc16":"The whole mansion is worried about what may happen if you attend the birthday banquet, but you have no choice but to go...",
"challengeDesc17":"Shan Ji asks Feng Yuntian to help, and the latter immediately sets out, bringing the Official Order granted by His Majesty along with him. Meanwhile, Shan Ji is in charge of the safe shipping of a batch of official currency.",
"challengeDesc18":"You and your men set off early to attend the banquet. After a full day of traveling, you spend the night in an inn. What you don't realize is that Zhang Cheng (Commander, Rank 8) has planned to ambush you right when you're getting ready for bed! Luckily, you manage to survive and even capture Zhang Cheng.",
"challengeDesc19":"During the banquet, Qian De requests that you release Zhang Cheng. Feng Yuntian arrives in the nick of time according to plan, and with a quick investigation soon unearths the official currency hidden in Qian's warehouse. He thus arrests Qian De on the spot.",
"challengeDesc20":"After helping to capture Qian De, you become allies with Shan Ji and Feng Yuntian.",
"challengeDesc21":"Several recent grave robberies have occurred in the cemeteries belonging to rich families. The Court has sent orders for you to investigate and find out what's going on.",
"challengeDesc22":"The next day, you intend to ask Zheng De, the Imperial Judge, to help you in your investigation. However, his butler refuses to even let you in.",
"challengeDesc23":"You become suspicious of the Imperial Judge, so you send Su Qi'er to observe the household in secret.",
"challengeDesc24":"You visit Zheng De once more. Strangely enough, the butler welcomes you inside with open arms this time.",
"challengeDesc25":"You finally get to meet Zheng De. What he does next, however, isn't at all what you expected...",
"challengeDesc26":"The reason Zheng De sends away his servants and asks to speak to you alone is that he wants to gift you some jade vessels. You decide to play along and accept the gifts. Later, you discuss the situation with Shan Ji and Lord Bao.",
"challengeDesc27":"The next day, you find a merchant and inform him of your plans to fake death. You also manage to find someone who's willing to construct a grave for you.",
"challengeDesc28":"After the grave is done, you head to Zheng De's mansion and tell him all about how the salt merchant has died.",
"challengeDesc29":"Just liked you expected, the impatient Zheng De decides to get to work on raiding the grave the same day the merchant is buried.",
"challengeDesc30":"As midnight rolls around, Zheng De and his men start carrying out their grave-robbing plans...",
"challengeDesc31":"Now that Zheng De and co. are inside the grave, you flip a switch to shut the grave entrance.",
"challengeDesc32":"The grave-robbing fiasco is now over, yet a sudden plague of malaria sweeps through the area, affecting many unfortunate civilians.",
"challengeDesc33":"Many soldiers in the barracks of Feng Yuntian and Shan Ji are hit hard by the disease as well. You send Su Qi'er into the Imperial City to ask for help from the Imperial Doctor.",
"challengeDesc34":"Su Qi'er manages to find Zhang Guangyang, the Imperial Doctor (Imperial Doctor, Rank 7 +), who tells him that the patients diagnosed with malaria need an antidote to be cured.",
"challengeDesc35":"The Imperial Doctor claims he's searching for the antidote—yet all he does every day is roam the gardens. Not until tons of civilians are on their deathbeds does he finally return to the Imperial City with the antidote.",
"challengeDesc36":"The Imperial Antidote sent by the Court doesn't seem to have much effect on the sick civilians.",
"challengeDesc37":"Su Qi'er runs into the daughter of the salt merchant, who seems to have already recovered from her illness.",
"challengeDesc38":"You begin to suspect that the antidote sent by the Court isn't all it seems. After appraisal, you realize that these herbs are indeed not what everyone thought they were.",
"challengeDesc39":"Thus, you decide to follow Zhang Guangyang in secret to figure out exactly where this `Imperial Antidote` came from.",
"challengeDesc40":"Ji Xiaolan runs into Zhang Guangyang at Blossom Tavern. The hostess, Lady Hua, tells him that Zhang is shipping the Imperial Antidote to Banyan Town with the help of Li Laocai (Minister of Transportation, Rank 6).",
"challengeDesc41":"After learning that Zhang Guangyang has substituted the original package of Imperial Antidote with something else, you decide to apply for medication from the Court again, and stealthily follow Zhang this time.",
"challengeDesc42":"Right as Zhang Guangyang is substituting the Imperial Antidote package, you and your men corner him at the Tavern and catch him in the act.",
"challengeDesc43":"After arresting Zhang Guangyang, you brew the real Imperial Antidote and distribute it to the civilians. Within three days, the patients begin to recover.",
"challengeDesc44":"Li Laocai, worried that the captured Zhang would spill the fact that he is also involved, sends an assassin to murder Zhang in the prison...",
"challengeDesc45":"The assassin is captured. Su Qi'er is ready to kill him then and there, but the terrified man attempts to bargain for freedom by selling out his employer.",
"challengeDesc46":"When Zhang Guangyang learns that Li Laocai has sent someone to assassinate him, he is very disappointed and makes a confession on the current whereabouts of the Imperial Antidote.",
"challengeDesc47":"On Market Day, Yuan Fang pretends to be a merchant, and catches the culprit red-handed.",
"challengeDesc48":"You are now highly esteemed by the civilians. As the Emperor happens to have plans to make rounds in the South, Prince Baylor sends a secret order that you will be the sole companion of His Majesty.",
"challengeDesc49":"As you and your men pass by an embroidery house, you notice an embroideress working on a canvas with the pattern of a knight hunting tigers. Prince Baylor wishes to purchase it, but the embroideress speaks up...",
"challengeDesc50":"You learn that Zhuang Dou (position: Minister of Judgment, Rank 6 +) enjoys lots of privileges in the area.",
"challengeDesc51":"You become interested in Zhuang Dou's background, and ask the Tavern Tender about it.",
"challengeDesc52":"Sometime ago, Zhuang Dou visited Kunshan County, and found Qian Hutu, the Mayor, dozing off on the podium. Zhuang Dou seized this opportunity to impeach the Mayor, and took all his jewels and treasures.",
"challengeDesc53":"You and your men discuss ways to put Zhuang Dou in his rightful place, but you soon learn that Zhao Kang, Zhuang Dou's father, used to be the tutor of the Emperor when His Majesty was a kid.",
"challengeDesc54":"Zhao Kang has many connections with the royal family—no wonder no one in the town dares to go against the Zhaos!",
"challengeDesc55":"As the Emperor is currently making rounds in the area, Zhuang Dou doesn't dare to collect any official currency for his own use. But he loves money too much to keep his hands clean—what to do? His butler comes up with a crazy scheme: collect taxes under the pretense of constructing a royal temple, and gain profit from the process.",
"challengeDesc56":"The next day, the butler of the Zhao family posts an announcement on the town gates, asking the poor civilians to turn in money. The town is buzzing with complaints. You and your companions happen to pass by the town gate at this moment...",
"challengeDesc57":"You find this royal temple fiasco a great opportunity to arrest Zhuang Dou, and decide to return to the inn to discuss how to go about doing it.",
"challengeDesc58":"You don't have any connections in Yangzhou with military powers. Therefore, you send a message to Shan Ji through pigeon post, asking him to aid in the arrest of Zhuang Dou.",
"challengeDesc59":"Three days later, Zhuang Dou leads a group of officials around town, collecting money and food from every house. You and your companions try to stop them, but are soon surrounded. Luckily Shan Ji and his men arrive just in time and put Zhuang Dou's group under arrest.",
"challengeDesc60":"Shan Ji beats up all of Zhuang's men—the poor guy barely has any idea who's behind all of this!",
"challengeDesc61":"[You and your men bring Zhuang Dou back to the Zhao mansion to go under trial. Zhuang Dou is probably laughing inside: `This is my home—I have the upper hand! Just you wait, I'll show you who's boss!`]",
"challengeDesc62":"[Meanwhile, Zhao Kang is writing essays in his study. Hearing the commotion, he comes out to check the situation, and hears Zhuang Dou screaming `Daddy, help me! Kill those dirty rascals!`]",
"challengeDesc63":"Zhao Kang hollers in rage, `How do you dare take the Mayor of the town captive?` While Zhuang Dou adds, `If you let me go, I just might spare you from a very painful death!`",
"challengeDesc64":"This is when Prince Baylor takes out his token and says, `Zhao Kang, look closely—what's this, huh?` Zhao Kang looks, and starts shaking uncontrollably.",
"challengeDesc65":"Before Zhao Kang can even utter another word, Prince Baylor continues: `I am Lord Pang. Please keep quiet about this. Everyone not involved, you may leave.` Zhao Kang, too, orders the others to leave.",
"challengeDesc66":"Zhuang Dou, poor guy, still has no idea what is going on, and continues wailing for his father to help him.",
"challengeDesc67":"[Zhuang Dou may be a delinquent, but Zhao Kang is an upright citizen. He kneels in front of Prince Baylor and pleads: `Lord Pang, it is my fault for not teaching my son well. Pray tell, what crime has that kid committed?`]",
"challengeDesc68":"Zhuang Dou forces civilians to cough up money under the pretense of constructing a royal temple. The people are already poor as it is due to the insect infestation in the Jiangnan area this year. Yet instead of providing aid to the suffering, Zhuang Dou is forcing them to pay taxes. This is a crime in itself!",
"challengeDesc69":"I just want to help develop this area. That's not a crime, is it?",
"challengeDesc70":"`Shut up!` Zhao Kang roars. `You're a shame to the family!`",
"challengeDesc71":"[Zhao Kang knows that, while he did commit crimes, Zhuang Dou would probably not be sentenced to death. To keep everything under wraps, he scolds Zhuang Dou in front of everyone and orders to put him into prison.]",
"challengeDesc72":"Next, Zhao Kang asks all others to leave, and whispers to Prince Baylor, `I am very sorry for not heading over to welcome Your Majesty, as I have not heard about your arrival. Please forgive me for my offense.`",
"challengeDesc73":"[Prince Baylor, deciding that Zhao Kang seems to be an honorable man, tells him:] `We're just here to scout the situation in the South before His Majesty arrives for a visit, and that's why we want to keep our identities a secret. From now on, you may call me Pang Jian in public.`",
"challengeDesc74":"[To thank Zhao Kang for having hosted a feast for the Royal Troops before and for being the Emperor's tutor, Prince Baylor orders him to become your assistant during your visit of the southern areas.]",
"challengeDesc75":"Sir Zhao, we are very grateful for your aid. I look forward to working with you to protect the safety of His Majesty.",
"challengeDesc76":"[Zhao Kang pretends to agree: `Of course, of course!`]",
"challengeDesc77":"[As soon as you and your men leave, Zhao Kang heads to the prison to speak to Zhuang Dou: `Once this whole thing dies down, Daddy will let you out. For now you'll have to stay in there, or else this will just snowball into something more serious.`]",
"challengeDesc78":"[The town is buzzing with rumors concerning Zhuang Dou's arrest. However, no one has any idea who exactly it was that put Zhuang Dou in jail.]",
"challengeDesc79":"[As the harvest has not been very lucrative this year, the highly-influential bandit Lin Bao, enemy of the Court, is eager to get his hands on Hangzhou City.]",
"challengeDesc80":"Shan Ji's troops are all extremely well-trained, so Prince Baylor gives orders to dispatch some of them to Hangzhou in order to have them watch over and train Zhuang Dou's officials and soldiers.",
"challengeDesc81":"Thank you, Your Majesty, for entrusting me with this job. I, Shan Ji, will take full responsibility to protect the Emperor during his visit to the South!",
"challengeDesc82":"We are more confident in our ability to protect His Majesty now that we have your help, Mr. Shan. You must be tired from your recent travels. You may go to your quarters to rest now. We will discuss the remaining matters tomorrow.",
"challengeDesc83":"[The next day, the bandit Lin Bao rallies the mountain bandits of Mt. Zhongyi to get ready to take over Hangzhou City.]",
"challengeDesc84":"[The peasants are all smiling in relief after learning that they no longer have to turn in any food or coins now that Zhuang Dou is under arrest.]",
"challengeDesc85":"[Lin Bao was once a Court official, but was later sentenced to exile. On his way, however, he managed to convince those in charge of keeping watch over him to join him, and took over Mt. Zhongyi of Hangzhou, becoming the chief of the local bandits.]",
"challengeDesc86":"[Having gathered his own band of bandits, Lin Bao brings all of them to the Blossom Tavern in Hangzhou, where the group can drink to their heart's content and have some fun with the tavern girls.]",
"challengeDesc87":"[The tenders at Blossom Tavern are all terrified out of their wits by the bandits, and have to sneak around as they serve these unwelcome guests, for fear of angering them.]",
"challengeDesc88":"Hey, you! Tell all the girls available in your tavern to come out and entertain my bros!",
"challengeDesc89":"Esteemed guest, the girls in our humble tavern are all resting right now. Could you please come back tomorrow instead?",
"challengeDesc90":"[Lin Bao attacks Lady Hua with a fan in rage and roars: `If the girls won't come out today, you all die!`]",
"challengeDesc91":"[The bandits begin hooting and chanting at top volume. Poor Lady Hua is scared out of her mind, and the tenders don't dare to make a sound either.]",
"challengeDesc92":"[Lady Hua tries to calm the bandits down by telling them to be patient, and asks a tender to go upstairs to get the girls ready.]",
"challengeDesc93":"[After having all the fun they want, Lin Bao and his band of bandits get ready to leave. They show no sign of wanting to pay.]",
"challengeDesc94":"[Lady Hua asks,] `Esteemed guests, you haven't settled the bill yet. Could you please...`",
"challengeDesc95":"[Lin Bao and co. burst out laughing.] `Oh please! Bandits paying bills? Can you imagine something as ridiculous as that? Are you asking for death, huh?`",
"challengeDesc96":"[There are too many bandits for Lady Hua to handle. And they're all made of pure muscle! Lady Hua has no idea what to do and falls to the ground, sobbing like a madwoman.]",
"challengeDesc97":"[She then tells the tenders to head to the Zhao mansion to report this incident to authorities.]",
"challengeDesc98":"[You and your companions happen to be in the Zhao mansion discussing the threats and issues in Hangzhou. After hearing what the tenders have to say, Zhao Kang exclaims:] `Ah, how could I forget this pesky Lin Bao?`",
"challengeDesc99":"[`Just who is this Lin Bao you speak of?` You ask.",
"challengeDesc100":"[`Ah, you're new here, so you don't know. This Lin Bao was once a Rank 5 Minister of Peace. On his way to exile, he planned a mutiny and recruited the officials who were supposed to watch over him to become part of his bandit group. That violent gang has been bothering us for years.`",
"challengeDesc101":"[Zhao Kang adds, `Lin Bao seems to have brought an unprecedented number of bandits to the town this time. They're probably have trouble up their sleeves!`]",
"challengeDesc102":"[`Do you have any idea just how many men there are in Lin Bao's gang?` You ask.]",
"challengeDesc103":"[`Two to three thousand, at least,` Zhao Kang replies.]",
"challengeDesc104":"[Shan Ji commands only at most a thousand men. If you want to attack Lin Bao directly, the troops may suffer some losses. Using a strategy to take the bandits out seems to be a better choice.]",
"challengeDesc105":"[Lin Bao and his bandits already have plans to break into the Liu family's house and take all their coins. As it is late now, the group is gathered in an inn, discussing their plans for the next day while downing bottle after bottle of booze.]",
"challengeDesc106":"[As soon as Su Qi'er hears about the bandits' plans, he heads back to the mansion to report to you.]",
"challengeDesc107":"[Su Qi'er: `A huge number of bandits will be attacking the Zhao mansion tomorrow.`]",
"challengeDesc108":"[When Zhao Kang hears about this, he pleads with you to stay and help him protect his mansion.]",
"challengeDesc109":"[Prince Baylor: `What insolence! Tomorrow, I will slay this Lin Bao with my very own hands!`]",
"challengeDesc110":"[You: `Please calm down, Your Majesty. Lin Bao definitely came prepared. We can't just go up to him and demand a fight.`]",
"challengeDesc111":"[You: `If this Lin Bao does attack the Zhao Mansion this time, we'll be in great trouble. We cannot let Your Majesty get hurt, so please, Your Majesty, you must stay away tomorrow. Don't forget that our priority is to scout out the current situation in the South to pave the way for the Emperor.`]",
"challengeDesc112":"[Zhao Kang: `I understand that the chances of us winning are slim. Please, Sir Shan, make sure that the Prince does not get hurt protecting my mansion. Or else I'll be too ashamed to face the Emperor!`]",
"challengeDesc113":"[Su Qi'er: `Please do not worry, Your Majesty. Sir Shan and I will guard you with our lives and capture the vile Lin Bao!`]",
"challengeDesc114":"[Liu Yong: `My Prince, you should stay at a safe distance tomorrow. If we do not make it out alive, you will have a chance to go back to the Imperial City and bring back more men to destroy Lin Bao!`]",
"challengeDesc115":"[Prince Baylor finally agrees to take your advice and observe the situation at a safe distance.]",
"challengeDesc116":"[You: `Sirs, do you have any ideas how we shall deal with Lin Bao?`]",
"challengeDesc117":"[Liu Yong: `I do have a plan, but it requires the assistance of Lord Zhao.`]",
"challengeDesc118":"[Zhao Kang is more than happy to hear that Liu Yong has a plan already. He exclaims, `Of course I'll be glad to provide assistance as long as it means that my home will be safe!`]",
"challengeDesc119":"[Liu Yong: `Lord Zhao, you only have a thousand soldiers on your side, and Lin Bao has two thousand. But what if his two thousand men are all sick?`]",
"challengeDesc120":"[Shan Ji: `In that case, I'd be able to have all of them cuffed and tied up in no time.`]",
"challengeDesc121":"[You urge Liu Yong: `Just tell us your plan now so we can get ready as soon as possible.`]",
"challengeDesc122":"[`Liu Yong: `Tomorrow, we'll pretend to suck up to Lin Bao by holding a feast for him and his bros. Of course, there will be wine, and if we add sleep potions into their drinks they'll be too drunk to notice. Once they're all asleep, they'll be easy prey.`]",
"challengeDesc123":"[Shan Ji: `Ah, Mr. Liu, you're a genius indeed! We'll be able to capture Lin Bao and his gang without lifting a finger!`]",
"challengeDesc124":"[Prince Baylor: `Sounds good to me. It's just that Sir Zhao will have to spend quite a bit of money.`]",
"challengeDesc125":"[Zhao Kang: `I don't mind splurging a bit as long as my home will be safe. It's just that...`]",
"challengeDesc126":"[All the property in the Zhao family is being managed by Zhuang Dou, and Zhao Kang actually has no idea where the money is.]",
"challengeDesc127":"[But Zhao Kang doesn't want to leak this information, for fear that it may further incriminate his son.]",
"challengeDesc128":"[Lin Bao: `We are here for the money! Hand us all the riches and treasures you've got in the house now!`]",
"challengeDesc129":"[Su Qi'er, standing by the side, can hardly contain his anger, but you hold him back in case he does anything rash.]",
"challengeDesc130":"[Zhao Kang: Ah, my dear brother Lin! I heard all about your arrival yesterday and have in fact prepared a lot of excellent treasures for you. I would have sent it over to you, but you're here earlier than I expected.]",
"challengeDesc131":"[Lin Bao: `Perfect, Lord Zhao. You know exactly how to make me happy! I can't wait to see the gold and jewels you've prepared for me!`]",
"challengeDesc132":"[Lin Bao's previously stormy expression has softened. Apparently he's not immune to flattery.]",
"challengeDesc133":"[Zhao Kang: `I bet you're all exhausted from your travels. How about I treat you all to a grand feast?`]",
"challengeDesc134":"[Lin Bao laughs. `Of course, of course! I knew you people of Yangzhou have a lot of respect for me. Bring the food!`]",
"challengeDesc135":"[Lin Bao: `Well, then, let's all sit down and get ready for dinner, shall we?`]",
"challengeDesc136":"[Zhao Kang: `Please make yourselves at home. I'll tell my chefs to whip up something delicious for our honorable guests.`]",
"challengeDesc137":"[Lin Bao sees you and your men hanging around, and asks Zhao Kang: `Who are those guys? I have no interest in drinking with lowly peasants. Send them off, won't you?`]",
"challengeDesc138":"[To ensure that the plan can go on smoothly, you and your men pretend to bid farewell to Zhao Kang and leave. However, Shan Ji's men have already sneakily surrounded the mansion.]",
"challengeDesc139":"[Su Qi'er: `How dare that asshat Lin Bao talk about you like this? Can't I just chop off his head so that they'll all shut up?`]",
"challengeDesc140":"[You: `Don't be rash! If you go inside right now, the whole plan would be foiled.`]",
"challengeDesc141":"[Meanwhile, Lin Bao's gang is having the time of their lives drinking away in the Zhao mansion. They have no idea they're surrounded by troops all around.]",
"challengeDesc142":"[Zhao Kang instructs the chefs to add sleep potion into the wine, and sends someone to alert Shan Ji, who is waiting outside.]",
"challengeDesc143":"[Zhao Kang: `Tell the servants to add this spiked wine into the glasses of each and every one of the guests. They must do it in person to make sure they've got all of them.`]",
"challengeDesc144":"[As soon as the bandits down the spiked wine, the sleep potion comes into effect.]",
"challengeDesc145":"[Zhao Kang winks at the guards, and Shan Ji immediately charges into the mansion, his men close behind.]",
"challengeDesc146":"[Lin Bao finally realizes what is going on, but it's too late. He tries to pick up his broadsword, but it falls to the ground with a clang. Unable to move, Lin Bao has to watch his gang being ruthlessly beaten up by Shan Ji's soldiers.]",
"challengeDesc147":"[You: `Lin Bao, traitorous snake! How do you dare rob an official's mansion in broad daylight? I'll bring you to justice right here, right now!`]",
"challengeDesc148":"[With the effects of the sleep potion and the alcohol, Lin Bao can barely move. All his attempts to get up are in vain.]",
"challengeDesc149":"[Prince Baylor: `Liu Yong is brilliant indeed! With his help, we caught this traitor without even breaking a sweat. Isn't it great to have so many strategists on our side?`]",
"challengeDesc150":"[After returning to the Imperial City from this journey, I will definitely recommend you all to His Majesty.]",
"challengeDesc151":"[You: `Thank you, Your Majesty, for your high esteem. We are very lucky to be able to work under a sensible man like you.`]",
"challengeDesc152":"[Meanwhile, Lin Bao and his men are gradually awakening as the effects of the sleep potion wear away. They begin to plan a prison break.]",
"challengeDesc153":"[The atmosphere in the prison is currently a bit concerning...]",
"challengeDesc154":"[Lin Bao: `Pass this on—tonight, we escape!`]",
"challengeDesc155":"[Indeed, at midnight, with a quick signal from Lin Bao, the bandits pick the locks of their prison gates, stab the jailers, and make their escape.]",
"challengeDesc156":"[Instead of getting revenge, Lin Bao and his gang flee back to Mt. Zhongyi.]",
"challengeDesc157":"[Soldier: `My Lord, we have a problem! Lin Bao and his men have broken out from prison and now they're all gone!`]",
"challengeDesc158":"[Zhao Kang: `Well, that's not unexpected. We don't have enough soldiers to guard the prisons and keep Lin Bao's men captive.`]",
"challengeDesc159":"[Zhao Kang: `What should we do now? Once Lin Bao recovers from his wounds, he'll definitely come back for me. I'm dead, I'm so dead...`]",

"challengeStoryDesc21":"[Yes, of course. The battle has begun, and the next is a life-and-death struggle.]",
"challengeStoryDesc22":"Zhao Qun (position: Minister of Inspection, Rank 9) may be a Court official, yet his actions are anything but noble.",
"challengeStoryDesc23":"Zhao Qun lets his son, Zhao Hu (position: Minister of Prison, Rank 9), do whatever he wants, including abducting your elder sister. It is time you punish the pair for their crimes.",
"challengeStoryDesc24":"[A group of unwelcome guests enter your house.] Ooh, look who's back! The new Champion, isn't it?",
"challengeStoryDesc25":"Who are you people?",
"challengeStoryDesc26":"Our Master Zhao Qun wants to invite you to visit him at his mansion tomorrow. If you don't show up, let's just say your days as an official will be over very soon...",
"challengeStoryDesc27":"That rascal, huh? Sure. Just you wait!",
"challengeStoryDesc28":"Of course. Do remember to come, or else...",
"challengeStoryDesc29":"Guys, let's go!",
"challengeStoryDesc30":"[After making rounds in town, you return to the mansion and discuss with your companions ways to deal with Zhan Qun.]",
"challengeStoryDesc31":"These two Zhaos, father and son, are a formidable combination—one crafty, one brawny. They have brought a lot of suffering to the townspeople.",
"challengeStoryDesc32":"I heard that Zhao Hu killed Lady Zhang's daughter not long ago. To protect his son, Zhao Qun put the blame on the innocent Liu Sixi.",
"challengeStoryDesc33":"[You can't help thinking about your sister when you hear about this. Your heart bleeds for her.]",
"challengeStoryDesc34":"We must take care of these bastards once and for all! No way we're letting them roam free for any longer.",
"challengeStoryDesc35":"My sister has been kept captive in the Zhao's mansion for a year already. She must have gone under so much torture. Let's set off tomorrow to capture that scoundrel Zhao Qun!",
"challengeStoryDesc36":"I, Su Qi'er, guarantee that I will rescue your sister. We'll show the Zhaos what true justice is!",
"challengeStoryDesc37":"[In the middle of your discussion, you hear a woman's voice screaming for help outside.]",
"challengeStoryDesc38":"My Lord, please stop... I'm not yet wed, you can't—no! Stop! Help! Help!",
"challengeStoryDesc39":"[You and your companions rush out to see what's going on.]",
"challengeStoryDesc40":"How dare you? You can't just go around touching random girls, right in front of an official's mansion, too!",
"challengeStoryDesc41":"[You dash over, shielding Lynn.] You okay, Lynnie?",
"challengeStoryDesc42":"Who do you think you are, huh? You know who my dad is?",
"challengeStoryDesc43":"[You realize that this must be the infamous Zhao Hu. Your heart leaps.] Speak of the devil...",
"challengeStoryDesc44":"Zhao Hu, you have committed countless sins these years. Do you admit your crimes?",
"challengeStoryDesc45":"Boys, arrest this good-for-nothing lowlife!",
"challengeStoryDesc46":"Who dares touch me?",
"challengeStoryDesc47":"You vagabond! The Court pays you salary for you to watch over the townspeople, not spend your days harassing them! I, Su Qi'er, will punish you in the name of the Heavens!",
"challengeStoryDesc48":"Can't believe you actually have the gall to lay hands on me... ",
"challengeStoryDesc49":"[As you are still new to your position, you aren't too sure about what will happen after you arrest Zhao Hu.]",
"challengeStoryDesc50":"[Seeing that you're troubled, Ji Xiaolan says:] `You've put Zhao Hu into prison. His father Zhao Qun will definitely not let this go so easily.`",
"challengeStoryDesc51":"I have a plan, however. Tomorrow, we make Su Qi'er dress up as a jailer to rescue your sister from where she is held captive. Next...",
"challengeStoryDesc52":"[The next day, you and your companions arrive at Zhao Qun's mansion and deploy your men all around the area.]",
"challengeStoryDesc53":"[When Zhao's servants notice your arrival, they send some of their own to lie in wait around the garden as well.]",
"challengeStoryDesc54":"So this is the Zhao mansion. I'm here to—",
"challengeStoryDesc55":"Yeah, yeah, I know who you are. Come on in!",
"challengeStoryDesc56":"[As soon as you step into the Zhao's garden, you have a feeling that something's off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc57":"Ah, you're the new official around here, huh? I thought you wouldn't dare turn up!",
"challengeStoryDesc58":"[Zhao Qun looks around, as if searching for something.]",
"challengeStoryDesc59":"You only started the job yesterday, yet I hear you've already arrested my men and even my son!",
"challengeStoryDesc60":"Why haven't you brought my son? You're not letting him go, huh?",
"challengeStoryDesc61":"Zhao Qun, you and your son have been causing nothing but trouble to the townspeople all these years. So many innocents have been put in jail because of you. Today, on the behalf of the Court and the people, I will end you!",
"challengeStoryDesc62":"[Meanwhile, Su Qi'er has already rescued your sister from the prison and sent her back home. He is now on his way to aid you in battle.]",
"challengeStoryDesc63":"Well, don't expect to leave alive now that you're in my garden. Forward, my men! Off with his head!",
"challengeStoryDesc64":"[The soldiers concealed in the garden appear and surround you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc65":"Oh please, do you think I would really come unprepared? Come on! What a joke!",
"challengeStoryDesc66":"Boys, arrest this wretched maggot and bring him back to the mansion!",
"challengeStoryDesc67":"[Your men, hearing your orders, come rushing in from outside the door.]",
"challengeStoryDesc68":"How fun. Guess it's time for a match to the death, huh?",
"challengeStoryDesc69":"[Su Qi'er arrives at the Zhao mansion in the nick of time.]",
"challengeStoryDesc70":"My Lord, I apologize for my lateness!",
"challengeStoryDesc71":"Zhao Qun, you scum, today is the date of your funeral!",
"challengeStoryDesc72":"[After arresting Zhaoqun,you come to Jail Cell to see the people，and hope they can  testify him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc73":"[What amazing you is hundreds of people are be held.]",
"challengeStoryDesc74":"[You ask an elder man:Why you be held by Zhaoqun?]",
"challengeStoryDesc75":"[The elder men crys and says:I was a tailor,because my daughter was so beautiful and loved by Zhaoqun.]",
"challengeStoryDesc76":"[My daughter was unwilling,and was tortured to death by Zhaohu.]",
"challengeStoryDesc77":"[I wanted to compalin ,but known by Zhaoqun, and I was sent to jail.More than three months.]",
"challengeStoryDesc78":"[Zhaoqun is so flagitious.]",
"challengeStoryDesc79":"[Mr Su,please send my people to the hospital. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc80":"[Yes,sir!]",
"challengeStoryDesc81":"[My Lords，you can back to mantion first,Let me deal with what comes down .]",
"challengeStoryDesc82":"[Thank you so much.]",
"challengeStoryDesc83":"[Late at night,you come out of sutdy room.]",
"challengeStoryDesc84":"[You sit there thinking about your father.] Father, I've rescued my sister and taken care of that jerk Zhao. I hope you're watching in the Heavens...",
"challengeStoryDesc85":"[Meanwhile, on the roof, several men clad in black are observing you in silence.]",
"challengeStoryDesc86":"Who's there?",
"challengeStoryDesc87":"[One of the men in black throws a dart, which hits the column beside your door. They all disappear into thin air.]",
"challengeStoryDesc88":"[Su Qi'er rushes after them, but they are nowhere to be found.]",
"challengeStoryDesc89":"[You find an envelope attached to the dart. In it is a note that says: Mind your own business, or die!]",
"challengeStoryDesc90":"My Lord, the Zhaos have connections in the Court. We need to be more careful from now on!",
"challengeStoryDesc91":"I am an upright official who works for the welfare for my people. I am afraid of nothing!",
"challengeStoryDesc92":"That's right, for our people! I, Su Qi'er, pledge to protect you and the mansion with my life!",
"challengeStoryDesc93":"[During your reign over the town, everything seems to be working out quite smoothly. The civilians are happy. The town is at peace.]",
"challengeStoryDesc94":"My Lord, there's a group of peasants at the door. They're asking to see you.",
"challengeStoryDesc95":"Hmm. I'll go talk to them.",
"challengeStoryDesc96":"My Lord, please have mercy on us! The grasshoppers are ravaging our crops. It's almost harvest time, but all the hard work we've put in this year is for naught. Please, my Lord, help us!",
"challengeStoryDesc97":"My Lord, the weather has been very dry this year—there's barely been any rain. That's what caused the grasshopper plague.",
"challengeStoryDesc98":"Are there any specialists in town that know how to deal with grasshoppers?",
"challengeStoryDesc99":"Tang Bohu at the Academy may be able to help.",
"challengeStoryDesc100":"All right, everyone, please do not worry. I will report this to the Court and ask for aid immediately, and see Tang Bohu to see if he has any ideas tomorrow.",
"challengeStoryDesc101":"[You discuss how to write a letter to request aid from the Court with Liu Yong, and send Su Qi'er to travel overnight to the Imperial City with it.]",
"challengeStoryDesc102":"Yes, Sir. I will set off right away.",
"challengeStoryDesc103":"[The next day, you and your men drive to the Academy to visit Tang Bohu.]",
"challengeStoryDesc104":"Sir Tang, do you have any suggestions on how to get rid of the grasshoppers?",
"challengeStoryDesc105":"Sir, the crops have all been destroyed. There's no saving them now. But...",
"challengeStoryDesc106":"But what? Fire away!",
"challengeStoryDesc107":"But if we limit the food source of the grasshoppers, they will be less likely to show up again, and we'll have excellent harvests in the future.",
"challengeStoryDesc108":"I see. So how do we limit the food source of the grasshoppers?",
"challengeStoryDesc109":"Grasshoppers love corn, wheat, sorghum, rice and millet. If the peasants burn all of those, I promise they'll have grand harvests next year.",
"challengeStoryDesc110":"My family and I will prescribe and distribute pesticide to the townspeople. They'll be well-prepared if the grasshoppers appear again.",
"challengeStoryDesc111":"Thank you, Sir Tang. I've already sent a request to the Court to send aid to the civilians. They'll be able to survive this year.",
"challengeStoryDesc112":"[Liu Gen (position: Mayor, Rank 9 +) hears that you have requested aid from the Court. The scheming fellow decides that he wants all the relief rations for himself.]",
"challengeStoryDesc113":"Butler, send some men to the town gates. Once the relief rations arrive, swap them with duds and bring the food back to our warehouse.",
"challengeStoryDesc114":"Yes, Sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc115":"[Once you arrive in your mansion, you rally the townspeople and instruct them on how to deal with the grasshopper problem according to Tang Bohu's guidelines.]",
"challengeStoryDesc116":"[Peasant: `But Sir, there is nothing edible in my house. What should we do?`]",
"challengeStoryDesc117":"Please rest easy, everyone. I have already reported the situation to the Court, and relief rations will arrive soon. Please be patient.",
"challengeStoryDesc118":"[At the other side of the town gates, Liu Gen (Mayor, Rank 9 +)'s men are concealed, ready to snatch the rations as soon as they arrive.]",
"challengeStoryDesc119":"Boys, stay vigilant! We'll take every single bag of those rations and slay every single unfortunate soul that happens to witness this!",
"challengeStoryDesc120":"Keep your guard up, everyone! We're gonna have such a great feast tonight!",
"challengeStoryDesc121":"[Right then, Su Qi'er arrives at the town gates with the relief rations.]",
"challengeStoryDesc122":"Forward, my brothers! Kill them all!",
"challengeStoryDesc123":"How dare you! These rations are for the civilians!",
"challengeStoryDesc124":"Civilians? I bet you want to keep them all for yourself! Boys, get him!",
"challengeStoryDesc125":"You, an official under the Court, want to take the food belonging to the starving townspeople? Over my dead body!",
"challengeStoryDesc126":"[The enemy has come prepared and has an advantage in numbers. Su Qi'er is seriously injured, but he continues to guard the rations with his life.]",
"challengeStoryDesc127":"Forth, my men! [Yuan Fang shows up in time, leading the soldiers from your mansion to support Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc128":"[Seeing this, Liu Gen screams:] `Retreat, retreat! Everyone, get outta here!`",
"challengeStoryDesc129":"Protect the Mayor! Let's get out of here!",
"challengeStoryDesc130":"`None of you are leaving today!` [Su Qi'er, with his last ounce of strength, leaps onto Liu Gen and pins him down.]",
"challengeStoryDesc131":"Boys, arrest them all! Leave no one behind!",
"challengeStoryDesc132":"[It turns out that you were a bit worried about the relief resources and had therefore sent Yuan Fang to aid Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc133":"What is this, Mr. Su? You're bleeding like crazy! Someone get a doctor, quick!",
"challengeStoryDesc134":"I would die a thousand times to serve you, my Lord!",
"challengeStoryDesc135":"Can't believe the Mayor's men would show up halfway to take the relief rations for themselves.",
"challengeStoryDesc136":"Liu Gen was once a bandit. His uncle Qian De (position: Vanguard, Rank 8) commands many troops. None of the lower local officials dare go against them.",
"challengeStoryDesc137":"My Lord, Mr. Su is seriously injured, and you are still new to the position, all alone without an ally in the Court. You should form connections with some influential figures who own troops!",
"challengeStoryDesc138":"You're right indeed, Mr. Ji!",
"challengeStoryDesc139":"[As you continue your discussion, you realize you've clean forgotten an important task that needs to be carried out.]",
"challengeStoryDesc140":"Oh dear, completely forgot that we need to distribute the relief resources. Yuan Fang, gather the townspeople now!",
"challengeStoryDesc141":"Yes, Sir. I'm on it!",
"challengeStoryDesc142":"[Hearing the good news, the townspeople assemble at the gates of your mansion, waiting to get their own portion of rations.]",
"challengeStoryDesc143":"[When they hear that Mr. Su has been seriously injured in attempt to protect the rations, they are concerned and ask to see him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc144":"Please don't worry. Mr. Su needs peace and quiet right now. I'll let him know about your well-wishes. Please, return home after you've received your rations.",
"challengeStoryDesc145":"[You have earned a lot of respect from the civilians after helping them combat grasshoppers and requesting aid to feed the starving families. They now see you as a noble, upright official.]",
"challengeStoryDesc146":"[Meanwhile, Shan Ji (position: Cavalry Officer, Rank 8) is observing you in secret from afar.]",
"challengeStoryDesc147":"This man seems quite talented. I shall tell Lord Feng Yuntian (position: Commander, Rank 8 +) about this!",
"challengeStoryDesc148":"[At the same time, Qian De has also sent men to observe you from afar.]",
"challengeStoryDesc149":"[The next day, you ask Yuan Fang to put up posters all over the town to recruit talented men to join you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc150":"[After a full day of interviews, you still haven't found anyone better suited for the job than Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc151":"[Suddenly, an assassin clad in black appears. He shouts:] `Freeze! You're that newbie Top Talent, aren't you?`",
"challengeStoryDesc152":"How dare you make an attempt on my life?",
"challengeStoryDesc153":"Boss's orders. I'm doing this for the money, you know. Die!",
"challengeStoryDesc154":"Who sent you?",
"challengeStoryDesc155":"Like I would ever tell you!",
"challengeStoryDesc156":"[Hearing the commotion, the townspeople nearby crowd over to watch.]",
"challengeStoryDesc157":"[Shan Ji has already guessed that someone might send an assassin to take you out sooner or later.]",
"challengeStoryDesc158":"You want to kill him? You'll have to kill me first!",
"challengeStoryDesc159":"[After a dramatic battle, Shan Ji finally defeats the assassin.]",
"challengeStoryDesc160":"Say it. Who is behind?",
"challengeStoryDesc161":"I'd rather die than tell you! [The assassin bites his own tongue in half and dies soon after.]",
"challengeStoryDesc162":"Doesn't look like he's doing this for the money, huh?",
"challengeStoryDesc163":"[Your arm has been sliced open by the assassin during your skirmish. The gash is long and quite deep.]",
"challengeStoryDesc164":"Thank you so much for saving my life, kind Sir. Pray tell, what is your name?",
"challengeStoryDesc165":"A fine man, indeed. You kept your cool in an attack. Quite impressive.",
"challengeStoryDesc166":"I'm the Cavalry Officer in the area. You can call me Zhao Qi, but I also go by—",
"challengeStoryDesc167":"[Before Shan Ji can even finish, you have already fallen to the ground, unconscious.]",
"challengeStoryDesc168":"[You wake up to find yourself safe back at home.]",
"challengeStoryDesc169":"[Your companions are all relieved to see that you have come to.]",
"challengeStoryDesc170":"Finally, my Lord! You've been out for three days! I was so worried!",
"challengeStoryDesc171":"What? Three days?",
"challengeStoryDesc172":"Pan from two streets over carried you home the other night. Just what happened?",
"challengeStoryDesc173":"I was on my way home but was intercepted by an assassin. A kind sir clad in black saved my life.",
"challengeStoryDesc174":"Shan Ji, you mean?",
"challengeStoryDesc175":"Yes, yes, him!",
"challengeStoryDesc176":"You kept mumbling his name when you were asleep.",
"challengeStoryDesc177":"Yuan Fang, please find out where Sir Shan lives for me. I must visit him in person to thank him.",
"challengeStoryDesc178":"How's Mr. Su doing? Are his wounds healing well?",
"challengeStoryDesc179":"Su Qi'er, who has been standing guard outside the door, walks in. `My Lord, I'm all recovered. Thanks for your concern.`",
"challengeStoryDesc180":"[The next day, Yuan Fang locates Shan Ji's mansion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc181":"Bring me to meet my savior now.",
"challengeStoryDesc182":"[You and your men arrive at the Cavalry Officer's mansion]",
"challengeStoryDesc183":"Who's there?",
"challengeStoryDesc184":"I am the new Top Talent who has only assumed the position recently. Your Master saved my life a few days ago. We are here to thank him.",
"challengeStoryDesc185":"Top Talent? What Top Talent? My Master has been at the Commander's mansion since three days ago. We're not taking any visitors. Leave!",
"challengeStoryDesc186":"[You and your companions are all very disappointed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc187":"When will your Master come home? I will come again to express my gratitude.",
"challengeStoryDesc188":"I'm not authorized to know about my Master's whereabouts. Guess you'll just need to be lucky.",
"challengeStoryDesc189":"[It turns out that Shan Ji has traveled overnight to the County Hall to visit Feng Yuntian.]",
"challengeStoryDesc190":"Greetings, Lord Shan. I will fetch Lord Feng right away.",
"challengeStoryDesc191":"Thanks.",
"challengeStoryDesc192":"Shan Ji, it's been a while! Come in, come in!",
"challengeStoryDesc193":"Yes, please come in, Lord Shan!",
"challengeStoryDesc194":"It's been a while indeed, Lord Feng. See, there's something I'd like to discuss with you today.",
"challengeStoryDesc195":"Sure, sure. You're a great friend of mine, no need to hold back.",
"challengeStoryDesc196":"There's a new Top Talent at Sha County, arrived not long ago. He's a righteous man, did a lot of good things for the townspeople.",
"challengeStoryDesc197":"I've been observing him in secret for a while. He's gotten into some trouble recently. He arrested Liu Gen, and as you can guess, Qian De will probably not be happy about that.",
"challengeStoryDesc198":"[Shan Ji gives Lord Feng an account on what happened as soon as he enters the mansion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc199":"Qian De? Isn't he your boss?",
"challengeStoryDesc200":"Exactly! That's also a reason I've come to seek your aid.",
"challengeStoryDesc201":"I may be a Cavalry Officer, but Qian De (position: Vanguard, Rank 8) is a cunning, unethical man. I don't want to work for him anymore.",
"challengeStoryDesc202":"You have a horrible boss, but you remain a virtuous person. I will support you, of course.",
"challengeStoryDesc203":"[Lord Feng thus agrees to Shan Ji's request to help you in secret.]",
"challengeStoryDesc204":"So what are you planning to do next?",
"challengeStoryDesc205":"I believe Qian De will attempt to get his nephew out of jail soon. The new Top Talent will definitely be in trouble when that happens.",
"challengeStoryDesc206":"I see. You shall return and watch over the new Top Talent in secret. When Qian De makes a move, send me a message through pigeon post immediately, and I'll be there right away!",
"challengeStoryDesc207":"Excellent idea, Lord Feng!",
"challengeStoryDesc208":"Do be careful once you get back. Keep your cool and don't do anything rash.",
"challengeStoryDesc209":"Thanks for the reminder, my Lord. Well, I'll be taking my leave now.",
"challengeStoryDesc210":"So soon? You've barely just arrived!",
"challengeStoryDesc211":"I didn't tell Qian De that I'd be leaving town. If I'm gone for too long, he'll be suspicious. Gotta go!",
"challengeStoryDesc212":"[Shan Ji bids Commander Feng farewell and speeds all the way back to Sha County.]",
"challengeStoryDesc213":"You're back, my Lord! During your absence, some guy calling himself the new Top Talent showed up every day to ask for you.",
"challengeStoryDesc214":"Ah, is that true?",
"challengeStoryDesc215":"Yes, a hundred percent true. He says he wants to thank you for saving his life.",
"challengeStoryDesc216":"Hmm, seems to be a polite man indeed.",
"challengeStoryDesc217":"Sir Shan, you're finally back.",
"challengeStoryDesc218":"Oh, it's the new Top Talent!",
"challengeStoryDesc219":"I awoke three days after that fatal night, and I've been waiting to see you ever since. We finally meet today!",
"challengeStoryDesc220":"Mr. Su, please bring the present to Sir Shan.",
"challengeStoryDesc221":"[During these few days, you asked the skillful Blacksmith Li to forge a beautiful sword out of the best materials.]",
"challengeStoryDesc222":"Sir Shan, it is impossible for me to repay your heroic deeds. Please take this sword as a token of my gratitude.",
"challengeStoryDesc223":"[Shan Ji, lover of swords, happily accepts your gift.]",
"challengeStoryDesc224":"It's a great sword indeed. Thank you so much.",
"challengeStoryDesc225":"[Sir Shan looks around, and whispers:] `My Lord, please come inside. There's something we need to discuss.`",
"challengeStoryDesc226":"Butler, please shut the gates. Do not allow anyone inside.",
"challengeStoryDesc227":"You've arrested Liu Gen. His uncle Qian De will definitely have something to say about this. I bet Qian De was the one who sent the assassin the other night.",
"challengeStoryDesc228":"I am righteous and work only to serve my people. I'm not afraid of those evil forces!",
"challengeStoryDesc229":"[Su Qi'er hangs his head, pleading guilty:] `It's my fault for not guarding you well, my Lord. Please give me the punishment I deserve!`",
"challengeStoryDesc230":"[You help Su Qi'er up.] `You were heavily injured when protecting the rations. It's not your fault at all!`",
"challengeStoryDesc231":"Thank you, Sir Shan, for saving my Lord. If anything happened to him, I would be too ashamed to continue living in this world.",
"challengeStoryDesc232":"Mr. Su, you're a devoted guard indeed. You're lucky to be working for a trustworthy master. I, on the other hand...",
"challengeStoryDesc233":"Sir Shan, what do you mean by that?",
"challengeStoryDesc234":"To be frank, Qian De is the local Vanguard, even though he's done nothing but torment the civilians. Yet I can do nothing about it, for he is my boss!",
"challengeStoryDesc235":"[Everyone looks surprised.]",
"challengeStoryDesc236":"You've arrested Qian De's nephew. He won't be happy about that and will probably send someone to your place very soon.",
"challengeStoryDesc237":"I was at the County Hall these few days, asking Lord Feng Yuntian to help you. However, as powerful as he is, he can't teleport here in seconds. You must be careful.",
"challengeStoryDesc238":"[Learning that Shan Ji has been arranging protection for you these few days, you feel extremely grateful.]",
"challengeStoryDesc239":"We've never met before, yet you saved my life and gave me so much support. How can I ever repay you?",
"challengeStoryDesc240":"I've been observing you from afar ever since you've taken up the position. You're truly a good man—a rare breed these days.",
"challengeStoryDesc241":"As we have the same morals and I'm indebted to you, why don't we become sworn brothers and share all the good and the bad from now on?",
"challengeStoryDesc242":"Sure, a kindred spirit is hard to come by. From now on, we're in the same boat.",
"challengeStoryDesc243":"[That is how you and Shan Ji become sworn brothers who share all hardships with each other.]",
"challengeStoryDesc244":"Though we're now sworn brothers, with Li Sihai still in the picture, we should avoid meeting up lest he gets suspicious. I'll tell my butler to bring you a message if something comes up.",
"challengeStoryDesc245":"You're right, Sir Shan. We shouldn't meet up too frequently, or you might be in trouble.",
"challengeStoryDesc246":"[The birthday of Qian De's mother is around the corner, and you receive an invitation to the party.]",
"challengeStoryDesc247":"I've sent the invitation. You must show up at the party to celebrate my mother's birthday.",
"challengeStoryDesc248":"You take a good look at the invitation. So it's from Qian De!",
"challengeStoryDesc249":"The Master says you must be present that day. If not, you and I both know very well what will happen next. Any other questions?",
"challengeStoryDesc250":"I recognize this handwriting—it belongs to Qian De indeed. Guess there's no way you're getting out of this, my Lord.",
"challengeStoryDesc251":"You arrested Qian De's nephew, yet he sends you an invitation anyway. He must have something up his sleeve.",
"challengeStoryDesc252":"Mr. Cao is right. Please think this over carefully, my Lord.",
"challengeStoryDesc253":"We should talk to Shan Ji about this.",
"challengeStoryDesc254":"[You've barely finished the sentence before Shan Ji appears from the back door.]",
"challengeStoryDesc255":"I'm guessing you've already received Qian De's invitation?",
"challengeStoryDesc256":"Wow, Sir Shan, you sure are fast. We just got the invitation and you've already turned up.",
"challengeStoryDesc257":"This is definitely a trap. We need to be fully prepared. I shall head to the County Hall now to discuss with Lord Feng.",
"challengeStoryDesc258":"Wait!",
"challengeStoryDesc259":"I've got an idea. We can take Qian De into custody at the banquet!",
"challengeStoryDesc260":"Whoa. You sure have guts. Arresting Qian De on his own banquet? That's unheard of!",
"challengeStoryDesc261":"[You already have a plan to convict Qian De of his crimes. However, you're a mere lowly official and are not authorized to arrest him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc262":"Please, Sir Shan, ask Lord Feng to join us. With his high position, he'll be able to arrest Qian De!",
"challengeStoryDesc263":"And I also need a favor from you, Mr. Su.",
"challengeStoryDesc264":"You have easy access to the Guard Commander's quarters. Ask someone to sneak some official currency in Qian De's warehouse the day before the banquet.",
"challengeStoryDesc265":"So you want to pin the blame on Qian De, huh?",
"challengeStoryDesc266":"I'm not pinning the blame on him—just giving him a taste of his own medicine!",
"challengeStoryDesc267":"[Once Shan Ji hears your plan, he sets off to the County Hall to speak to Feng Yuntian.]",
"challengeStoryDesc268":"[Meanwhile, Qian De and his sworn brother Zhang Chen (Commander, Rank 8) are brainstorming for ways to kill you before you even arrive.]",
"challengeStoryDesc269":"You will have to travel for more than one day to reach Qian De's mansion. You must be careful on the way.",
"challengeStoryDesc270":"I heard that bandits run rampant on the route. You should bring a few soldiers with you.",
"challengeStoryDesc271":"My Lord, I'm worried! Can't I come with you?",
"challengeStoryDesc272":"You may not. This is very dangerous. If anything happens to me, you need to take care of my sister for me.",
"challengeStoryDesc273":"Don't say that! Nothing's going to happen to you. You'll come back safe and sound.",
"challengeStoryDesc274":"Mr. Su, please watch over my Lord for me!",
"challengeStoryDesc275":"[Time is running out. Shan Ji rushes all the way to the Commander's mansion, without even stopping once.]",
"challengeStoryDesc276":"[*Knock knock* Open up! Open the door!]",
"challengeStoryDesc277":"Who is it? Who dares disturb our Master this late? What horrible manners!",
"challengeStoryDesc278":"[The butler of the Commander swings open the door.] `Oh, it's Shan Ji. What's up? What's the hurry?`",
"challengeStoryDesc279":"[Feng Yuntian comes out to greet him also, a jacket slung over his shoulders.]",
"challengeStoryDesc280":"Lord Feng, Qian De has made his move!",
"challengeStoryDesc281":"Wow, so fast, huh?",
"challengeStoryDesc282":"Qian De's mother will be celebrating her eightieth birthday the day after tomorrow. And he's invited the new Top Talent to join the banquet...",
"challengeStoryDesc283":"He's quite a smart one indeed. He's made plans to arrest Qian De then and there, during the banquet. All we need now is for Lord Feng to show up and convict Qian of his crimes!",
"challengeStoryDesc284":"[After Commander Feng hears your plans, he can't help praising you for your strategic skills and daring attitude.]",
"challengeStoryDesc285":"Butler, bring me the official order from His Majesty. We'll lend Shan Ji the official currency in the warehouse for a few days.",
"challengeStoryDesc286":"All right, no time to waste. Let's go!",
"challengeStoryDesc287":"Shan Ji immediately sets out to make arrangements for the official currency.",
"challengeStoryDesc288":"[You and your companions set off to attend the banquet as soon as the sun rises.]",
"challengeStoryDesc289":"Be careful, my Lord! Mr. Su, please watch over my Lord and the other Sirs!",
"challengeStoryDesc290":"Of course. I won't let anyone touch him.",
"challengeStoryDesc291":"[After a day of traveling, you pass by an inn at twilight.]",
"challengeStoryDesc292":"My Lord, this inn feels a bit off. The employees all look malicious. We'd better be careful.",
"challengeStoryDesc293":"Isn't this the new Top Talent? You're here to attend the birthday party as well?",
"challengeStoryDesc294":"[You ignore Zhang Cheng and speak to the innkeeper instead.] `Please bring us some tea. That's all we need.`",
"challengeStoryDesc295":"[Zhang pipes up:] `Boys, hurry up and serve tea for the Top Talent!`",
"challengeStoryDesc296":"My Lord, something doesn't feel right. This Zhang Cheng seems to have been lying in wait for you to arrive.",
"challengeStoryDesc297":"Esteemed customer, your tea is here!",
"challengeStoryDesc298":"Be careful, my Lord. Let me try something first.",
"challengeStoryDesc299":"[Liu Yong takes out a silver needle and dips it into the tea. The silver needle immediately turns an ominous black.]",
"challengeStoryDesc300":"The gall! They've poisoned the tea!",
"challengeStoryDesc301":"[Zhang Chen and the inn employees realize that they've been found out and whip out their weapons right away.]",
"challengeStoryDesc302":"You're asking for this! Brothers, kill them all!",
"challengeStoryDesc303":"[Zhang Chen's men are no match for Su Qi'er, and you soon capture the whole group.]",
"challengeStoryDesc304":"[The next day, you arrive at Qian De's mansion. The Vanguard's butler is very surprised to see you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc305":"[Meanwhile, Shan Ji has returned and worked out all the arrangements concerning the official currency.]",
"challengeStoryDesc306":"Ah, it's the new Top Talent! How kind of you to have traveled so far to attend my mother's humble birthday party!",
"challengeStoryDesc307":"Sir Chen, it's an honor! I had the chance to fight a few battles on the way too. It was good practice!",
"challengeStoryDesc308":"[Qian De looks annoyed and heads to greet other guests instead.]",
"challengeStoryDesc309":"[After the banquet starts, Qian De feigns ignorance and asks:] `Where's my nephew Liu Gen? Why is he not here at this important occasion?`",
"challengeStoryDesc310":"[You know Qian De is challenging you on purpose, but you answer anyway:] `Not long ago, Qian De attempted to rob the people of the relief rations sent by the Court. I arrested him and put him into prison.`",
"challengeStoryDesc311":"But Liu Gen has always been such an obedient child! He would never do something like that! You must be lying, huh?",
"challengeStoryDesc312":"[Seeing that you haven't brought many men with you, Qian De convinces other local officials to join him in demanding you to release Liu Gen.]",
"challengeStoryDesc313":"[In the meantime, Feng Yuntian has also arrived at the Grand Council. He explains:] `I happen to be traveling through this area, but figured I should drop by since you people are being so loud.`",
"challengeStoryDesc314":"The civilians around here barely have enough to survive, yet you people are holding a banquet! Where do you get all your money from? Boys, search the warehouse!]",
"challengeStoryDesc315":"[Everything goes according to plan. Feng Yuntian's men find a huge amount of official currency in the warehouse. Qian De himself is shocked as well.]",
"challengeStoryDesc316":"My Lord, I'm innocent! I really am innocent!",
"challengeStoryDesc317":"[Now that Qian De is finally arrested, the townspeople can all go about their lives happily.]",
"challengeStoryDesc318":"So you're the new kid on the block? Quite courageous and clever indeed. Shan Ji has a good eye in spotting talent.",
"challengeStoryDesc319":"Please, Lord Feng, I couldn't have done it without you. If you hadn't arrived in time, I would probably be in prison right now instead of Qian De.",
"challengeStoryDesc320":"How very humble! We're both working for the Court. I assure you, I'm only too happy to do anything I can to help.",
"challengeStoryDesc321":"I'm really grateful for you to have come so far to provide your aid, Lord Feng. I will no longer need to work under this heartless official now.",
"challengeStoryDesc322":"Sir Shan, you're quite efficient indeed. You traveled to and from the County Hall in just three days! That's unheard of!",
"challengeStoryDesc323":"I'm still new here, and I'm very fortunate to have you two kind Sirs on my side.",
"challengeStoryDesc324":"How about the three of us form an alliance and work together for the welfare of our people? What do you two think?",
"challengeStoryDesc325":"That's what I've been thinking about too. Lord Feng, what about you?",
"challengeStoryDesc326":"The world is in chaos right now. If I decline to work with you, it would be the same as refusing to protect my people!",
"challengeStoryDesc327":"[Thus you, Shan Ji and Feng Yuntian become allies and sworn brothers. From now on, you share all the pain and happiness of official life with each other.]",
"challengeStoryDesc328":"[Though Shan Ji used to work under Qian De, the civilians continue to support him for his upright morals even after Qian De is arrested.]",
"challengeStoryDesc329":"[Soon, Shan Ji is promoted to the position of Imperial Commander Envoy.]",
"challengeStoryDesc330":"[When you hear this good news, you head to Shan Ji's mansion to congratulate him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc331":"Sir Shan, I'm here to give you my wholehearted congratulations.",
"challengeStoryDesc332":"Ha, kid, no need to be so formal with me!",
"challengeStoryDesc333":"Anyway, the three of us finally have command over more troops. This definitely calls for a celebration.",
"challengeStoryDesc334":"[Some of the graves of rich families have been robbed frequently in the past few days. Many valuable burial sacrifices have gone missing.]",
"challengeStoryDesc335":"A lot of grave robberies have been occurring these days. We have yet to find out who's behind them. The Court has asked me to investigate the matter.",
"challengeStoryDesc336":"Wow, who dares steal valuables from dead people? Aren't they worried about karma?",
"challengeStoryDesc337":"These grave robbers seem to be quite familiar with the graves. They're able to take out everything from a simple grave within just one night.",
"challengeStoryDesc338":"That's outrageous! Any idea what to do?",
"challengeStoryDesc339":"I shall talk to the Minister of Etiquette tomorrow. He might be able to come up with something.",
"challengeStoryDesc340":"If you need me for anything, don't hesitate to say so.",
"challengeStoryDesc341":"[The next day, you set off for the mansion of Zheng De (Minister of Etiquette, Rank 7) to see if he would be able to help.]",
"challengeStoryDesc342":"Who are you? And why are you here?",
"challengeStoryDesc343":"I'm the new official who has just assumed position in the local area. There's something I would like to discuss with your Master about.",
"challengeStoryDesc344":"Oh, the new official, huh? Just tell me what you're here for, then. My Master don't welcome visitors easily.",
"challengeStoryDesc345":"How condescending!",
"challengeStoryDesc346":"Su Qi'er, what impudence!",
"challengeStoryDesc347":"I was appointed by the Court to investigate the recent grave robberies that have been happening in the area. We are hoping that your Master may be able to help us.",
"challengeStoryDesc348":"[The butler of the Minister of Etiquette pales visibly when he hears this, but quickly regains composure.]",
"challengeStoryDesc349":"That's no news here. My Master isn't in charge of affairs like this. Go! Go!",
"challengeStoryDesc350":"[The butler of the Minister of Etiquette shuts the door in your face.]",
"challengeStoryDesc351":"How can a local Minister of Etiquette not be in charge of affairs like this? Shouldn't they be responsible for the welfare of their people?",
"challengeStoryDesc352":"The butler was acting a bit strange. He looked suspicious to me.",
"challengeStoryDesc353":"Same!",
"challengeStoryDesc354":"[You note that the butler of the Minister of Etiquette looks abnormally nervous and asks Su Qi'er to follow Zheng De in secret.]",
"challengeStoryDesc355":"[You shout at the butler through the door:] `Please tell your Master that I'll be back!`",
"challengeStoryDesc356":"[After you leave with your men, the butler of the Minister of Etiquette rushes into the study to inform Zheng De of your arrival.]",
"challengeStoryDesc357":"My Lord, my Lord, we're in trouble!",
"challengeStoryDesc358":"Quiet! Stop yelling, you're getting on my nerves.",
"challengeStoryDesc359":"My Lord, the jig is up. The Court is sending someone to investigate the grave robberies!",
"challengeStoryDesc360":"And that's an issue because? That was just a lowly local official. There's nothing he can do.",
"challengeStoryDesc361":"But that man looked very majestic. He is probably more than your run-of-the-mill lowly official!",
"challengeStoryDesc362":"You think? I'd like to meet him then. Why don't you invite him in?",
"challengeStoryDesc363":"Uh, I already asked him to leave...",
"challengeStoryDesc364":"Tch, useless! You shouldn't make the decision without asking me first. Now he'd think we're guilty!",
"challengeStoryDesc365":"I...",
"challengeStoryDesc366":"The official who just visited said they would visit again!",
"challengeStoryDesc367":"All right. Everyone, collect all the jade vessels in the house and hide them!",
"challengeStoryDesc368":"[While this is going on, Su Qi'er is secretly observing everything in the mansion garden.]",
"challengeStoryDesc369":"My Lord, after you left, the servants in the Wu mansion have been busy moving objects around. From my experience, I bet they're transporting jade vessels.",
"challengeStoryDesc370":"Really?",
"challengeStoryDesc371":"Yes, and a lot of jade vessels at that!",
"challengeStoryDesc372":"How could a Minister of Etiquette own so many jade vessels? That doesn't sound normal.",
"challengeStoryDesc373":"What if...",
"challengeStoryDesc374":"[The next day, you and your men visit Zheng De again. This time, the butler is much politer.]",
"challengeStoryDesc375":"It's you, my Lord! I apologize for yesterday. My Master wasn't feeling well and couldn't see any visitors. I'm very sorry.",
"challengeStoryDesc376":"Please have a seat in the lounge. I'll fetch my Master.",
"challengeStoryDesc377":"[You finally meet Zheng De (position: Minister of Etiquette, Rank 7).]",
"challengeStoryDesc378":"*coughing* Ah, my apologies, my Lord. I should have come out to welcome you, but I didn't realize that you were here.",
"challengeStoryDesc379":"It's all right. It's my fault for disturbing you when you're sick. Please forgive me, Lord Wu.",
"challengeStoryDesc380":"I am appointed by the Court to investigate the local grave robberies, and I was just wondering whether Lord Wu could give me any pointers.",
"challengeStoryDesc381":"Grave robberies are a common occurrence here. There's no preventing it from happening.",
"challengeStoryDesc382":"You're new, so you haven't realized yet. All you need to do is get used to it.",
"challengeStoryDesc383":"[You're taken aback by the lack of action on Zheng De's part.]",
"challengeStoryDesc384":"Lord Wu, are you afraid of trouble?",
"challengeStoryDesc385":"Insolent fool! How dare you talk about my Master like this? Who do you think you are?",
"challengeStoryDesc386":"Silence! It's not your place to speak. Out, out! Let me talk with this kind Sir alone.",
"challengeStoryDesc387":"[After sending the others away, Zheng De does something completely unexpected.]",
"challengeStoryDesc388":"[Zheng De takes out a jade vessel and hands it to you.] `Here, take this. As long as you promise not to investigate the matter, I guarantee that you and your family will never go hungry even if you do nothing and sleep all day from now on.`",
"challengeStoryDesc389":"[You are shocked by what Zheng De did, and you're now more suspicious than ever. However, you decide that it would be better to pretend to go along with the plan.]",
"challengeStoryDesc390":"Aw, there's no way I can accept that. You're older than me, I should be the one bringing you gifts! I apologize for my lack of manners. I really should have brought something today.",
"challengeStoryDesc391":"Please don't bother. We're family from now on. All my belongings are yours as well.",
"challengeStoryDesc392":"[You decide to go along with the plan for now and accept Zheng De's jade vessel.]",
"challengeStoryDesc393":"[Once you're back in the mansion, you ask Su Qi'er to get Feng Yuntian and Shan Ji, so that you can all appraise the jade vessel together.]",
"challengeStoryDesc394":"[As soon as Feng Yuntian sees the jade vessel, he exclaims,] `Isn't this supposed to be in General Wen's grave? How did you obtain it?`",
"challengeStoryDesc395":"[You explain the source of the jade vessel to the other two.]",
"challengeStoryDesc396":"I went to visit the Wu mansion once before. The butler had this really suspicious face when he heard what I was there for. And during this visit, I received this jade. I can't help but suspect that...",
"challengeStoryDesc397":"My Lord, I may have a plan, though I'm not sure if it's an appropriate one...",
"challengeStoryDesc398":"Please do tell.",
"challengeStoryDesc399":"We can create a fake grave and pretend to hold a huge funeral. This way, we'll be able to dupe the culprits into showing themselves.",
"challengeStoryDesc400":"That's a great idea! Brother, you sure do have many clever strategists working for you!",
"challengeStoryDesc401":"[You hear that there's a merchant in town known for his love for jade, and head over to his place for a visit.]",
"challengeStoryDesc402":"[You ask the merchant to pretend to die, and explain the objective. The merchant is happy to comply.]",
"challengeStoryDesc403":"Now the biggest problem is where to find someone to build a grave.",
"challengeStoryDesc404":"I'm on it. No need to worry!",
"challengeStoryDesc405":"[The next day, Yuan Fang brings a grave-builder to you. You instruct him to create a trap on the crypt door.]",
"challengeStoryDesc406":"[Grave-builder: `I will do my best, my Lord.`]",
"challengeStoryDesc407":"Please, everyone, keep the construction of the grave a secret. We don't want to alert the criminals to what we're doing.",
"challengeStoryDesc408":"I'll send some soldiers from the troops to help build the grave so as to speed the process up.",
"challengeStoryDesc409":"Thanks, Sir Shan. We need to hurry. The sooner we capture the culprits, the sooner we'll be able to prevent all future grave robberies.",
"challengeStoryDesc410":"[After three days of secret construction, the grave is finally complete.]",
"challengeStoryDesc411":"[According to plan, you spread the news of the death of the salt merchant.]",
"challengeStoryDesc412":"[The next day, you head to Zheng De's mansion for a chat, in order to pass on the information in an inconspicuous way.]",
"challengeStoryDesc413":"Lord Wu, how've you been? Is your cough getting better?",
"challengeStoryDesc414":"*coughing* Thank you, dear Sir, for visiting. I'm much better now.",
"challengeStoryDesc415":"You should take care of your health, you know. I've heard that the salt merchant in town passed away recently because of constant overwork. You'd better not be like him!",
"challengeStoryDesc416":"[Zheng De is delighted to hear this news.]",
"challengeStoryDesc417":"You mean that salt merchant in town who's known for his love for jade?",
"challengeStoryDesc418":"Yes, him. You knew him?",
"challengeStoryDesc419":"[Zheng De immediately conceals his glee and says:] `No, no. Just heard about him, that's all.`",
"challengeStoryDesc420":"[Zheng De, too, is a jade lover. He knows that the merchant owns many rare, exquisite jade treasures and can't wait to lay his hands on them.]",
"challengeStoryDesc421":"[The salt merchant's death is the perfect opportunity for him to take those craved jade items for himself.]",
"challengeStoryDesc422":"I heard that the salt merchant had quite the collection of precious treasures. They will probably place a lot of those in his crypt, I assume?",
"challengeStoryDesc423":"[Zheng De is ecstatic over your musings, but dares not show his excitement.]",
"challengeStoryDesc424":"[Pretending to be unaffected, Zheng De murmurs: `Hmm, true.`]",
"challengeStoryDesc425":"[You take your leave after telling Zheng De the fake news.]",
"challengeStoryDesc426":"Lord Wu, you still need to rest and take care of yourself. I'll be off now.",
"challengeStoryDesc427":"[As soon as you leave, Zheng De calls his butler over and tells him to ask around for the whereabouts of the merchant's grave.]",
"challengeStoryDesc428":"Yes, Sir, I'm on it!",
"challengeStoryDesc429":"[Not soon after, the butler comes back, panting hard.] `M-my lord, the salt merchant will be buried tomorrow.`",
"challengeStoryDesc430":"[Zheng De claps and exclaims,] `Perfect! Gather everyone and collect all the tools. Time is ticking! And be discreet.`",
"challengeStoryDesc431":"Yes, Sir. Rest easy, I'll make sure everything is order.",
"challengeStoryDesc432":"[You have already dispatched men to observe everything that is going on at the Wu mansion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc433":"As you expected, my Lord, Zheng De is going to carry out the plans tomorrow night.",
"challengeStoryDesc434":"[As planned, the salt merchant's funeral will be held today. His servants are all present to send their master off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc435":"[Meanwhile, Zheng De and his men watch the funeral go on from afar.]",
"challengeStoryDesc436":"Breaking into this grave would be a piece of cake. I'll become a rich man tonight!",
"challengeStoryDesc437":"Yes, yes! Congratulations, Master!",
"challengeStoryDesc438":"[Zheng De whacks his butler on the back of his head.] `Shh! Be quiet!`",
"challengeStoryDesc439":"[After the funeral affairs are over, it is already late and the servants have all returned to their quarters. In the meantime, Shan Ji's men have already concealed themselves in the bushes.]",
"challengeStoryDesc440":"Boys, it's midnight—time to get to work! Dig away, dig away! And be careful—if you damage any of the goods, I'll give you a good flogging when we get home.",
"challengeStoryDesc441":"[After hours of digging, Zheng De's men have finally dug their way to the crypt entrance.]",
"challengeStoryDesc442":"Master, look! Look!",
"challengeStoryDesc443":"[Zheng De's jaw drops. His men stare as well, eyes as big as saucers.]",
"challengeStoryDesc444":"Ha, it's like a gift sent from the Heavens! This is all mine now! Ha!",
"challengeStoryDesc445":"[Zheng De and his men find heaps of jade vessels inside the crypt. They can barely contain their excitement.]",
"challengeStoryDesc446":"[While this is going on, you activate the switch to shut the crypt gate.]",
"challengeStoryDesc447":"Eek, the door closed by itself! Master! What should we do?",
"challengeStoryDesc448":"Must be supernatural forces! Help! Somebody help!",
"challengeStoryDesc449":"[While the group is screaming for help, you send orders to your men.]",
"challengeStoryDesc450":"Everyone, surround the crypt.",
"challengeStoryDesc451":"Boys, take 'em!",
"challengeStoryDesc452":"[You reopen the crypt gates. Zheng De and his men peer out timidly, and are shocked by what they're seeing.]",
"challengeStoryDesc453":"Ah, Lord Wu, you've recovered from your cold, huh? You're clearly in good enough health to come out and dig graves at midnight!",
"challengeStoryDesc454":"You wretched lowlife! How dare you set up my Master like this!",
"challengeStoryDesc455":"How could you, a Minister of Etiquette, an official of the Court, do something like this? Do you have no shame?",
"challengeStoryDesc456":"Rascal! I can't believe I trusted you!",
"challengeStoryDesc457":"Arrest them all!",
"challengeStoryDesc458":"Yes, Sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc459":"My Lord, you're brilliant indeed! We've captured the robbers without lifting a finger.",
"challengeStoryDesc460":"I'd have to thank Mr. Ji for his excellent idea.",
"challengeStoryDesc461":"I'm flattered.",
"challengeStoryDesc462":"[You complete the task assigned by the Court in record time, and the Court officials are all incredibly impressed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc463":"[Everything seems to be on the right track. The town is finally at peace—yet soundlessly, inconspicuously, a malaria plague creeps upon the innocent civilians.]",
"challengeStoryDesc464":"My Lord, there's a group of people outside.",
"challengeStoryDesc465":"[Townspeople: `My Lord, please help us! My whole family is suffering from killer headaches, and we have no idea why!`]",
"challengeStoryDesc466":"My Lord, this doesn't sound good. The malaria from the neighboring villages must have spread to our town.",
"challengeStoryDesc467":"Eh, really? I've heard that this malaria is extremely hard to cure, and spreads speedily. My Lord, come back in the mansion. You can't get sick too!",
"challengeStoryDesc468":"[Townspeople: `Don't go! My Lord, please save us!`]",
"challengeStoryDesc469":"I'm an official of the Court—I'm not afraid of death! Please rest assured, everyone. I'll do everything I can to help.",
"challengeStoryDesc470":"[The malaria crisis isn't something you would be able to solve yourself with your limited medical knowledge, so you instantly decide to set off to the Imperial City to ask the Imperial Doctor for help.]",
"challengeStoryDesc471":"My Lord, you should stay here inside the mansion. There are hordes of infected civilians on the streets, and if you get the disease from them, they'll have no one to turn to.",
"challengeStoryDesc472":"My Lord, Mr. Su is right. Besides, Mr. Su might actually have a better chance of seeing the Imperial Doctor if he goes alone.",
"challengeStoryDesc473":"I will remain here, then. Mr. Su, do be careful on your way.",
"challengeStoryDesc474":"[Su Qi'er bids you farewell and speeds off towards the Imperial City.]",
"challengeStoryDesc475":"[In the meantime, Feng Yuntian and Shan Ji have also arrived at your mansion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc476":"My brothers, how've you been?",
"challengeStoryDesc477":"Can't believe the plague has spread to our county already. Some soldiers in my troops caught the malaria too when they were on the frontline working to control floods.",
"challengeStoryDesc478":"Brothers, please don't worry. Mr. Su has already departed to the Imperial City to ask for the Imperial Doctor.",
"challengeStoryDesc479":"My Lord, the most urgent matter now is to quarantine those who have the disease, so that they don't give it to anyone else.",
"challengeStoryDesc480":"Mr. Liu is right indeed!",
"challengeStoryDesc481":"[You visit the sick and quarantine them, bringing the plague under control for the time being.]",
"challengeStoryDesc482":"[Two days later, Su Qi'er manages to bring Zhang Guangyang (Imperial Doctor, Rank 7 +) to your town.]",
"challengeStoryDesc483":"[As you expected, the disease the townspeople have caught is malaria indeed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc484":"[After seeing the patients, Zhang Guangyang flees from the quarantine zone, hand on his nose.]",
"challengeStoryDesc485":"Lord Zhang, can these patients be cured?",
"challengeStoryDesc486":"Oh please, it's just malaria, nothing big! I, Zhang Guangyang, can cure anything!",
"challengeStoryDesc487":"Wonderful! Our people can be saved!",
"challengeStoryDesc488":"Don't rejoice just yet. To combat malaria, we need the Imperial Antidote, which is quite hard to come by. I'll need to conduct a search for it.",
"challengeStoryDesc489":"Can I help?",
"challengeStoryDesc490":"What do you know? I'll look for it myself.",
"challengeStoryDesc491":"You've got quite a temper, doc. Are you sure you're really capable of healing the people?",
"challengeStoryDesc492":"Don't talk to my Master like that. If you're so high and mighty yourself, why don't you cure the patients then?",
"challengeStoryDesc493":"[The arrogance of the Imperial Doctor irks everyone present, but there's nothing they can do about it.]",
"challengeStoryDesc494":"[It turns out that the Imperial Doctor is in fact a sex fiend who spends his days in the Blossom Tavern instead of working on finding the cure.]",
"challengeStoryDesc495":"[As time passes, the condition of the sick townspeople worsens all of a sudden.]",
"challengeStoryDesc496":"My Lord, help! Help! Lots of the patients are foaming at the mouth and writhing in agony! ",
"challengeStoryDesc497":"Get Lord Zhang now!",
"challengeStoryDesc498":"I've been searching high and low these days, but nothing can be found here. It would probably be faster to just ask the Emperor to send us the Imperial Antidote.",
"challengeStoryDesc499":"Mr. Su, head into the Imperial City this instant and ask the Court for the antidote.",
"challengeStoryDesc500":"Yes, Sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc501":"Wait, wait! You people know nothing about the disease. I shall go myself and ask for aid instead.",
"challengeStoryDesc502":"That's great! With the Imperial Doctor helping us, we'll get the antidote in no time.",
"challengeStoryDesc503":"[The next day, Zhang Guangyang heads back to the Imperial City to obtain medicine.]",
"challengeStoryDesc504":"My Lord, my Lord, the antidote is here!",
"challengeStoryDesc505":"Perfect. Quick, let's brew it for the townspeople!",
"challengeStoryDesc506":"Where's your Master, by the way?",
"challengeStoryDesc507":"The salt merchant's daughter's caught the disease as well. My Master's gone to tend to her and will arrive here tomorrow. You can brew the antidote in the meantime.",
"challengeStoryDesc508":"[After taking the Imperial Antidote from the Court, the townspeople seem to have recovered slightly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc509":"Why did the Imperial Doctor visit the salt merchant's daughter instead of coming over to brew the medicine for the rest of the people?",
"challengeStoryDesc510":"That Imperial Doctor doesn't seem to be an honest person.",
"challengeStoryDesc511":"[You find out that the salt merchant has paid the Imperial Doctor extra so that he would come and see his daughter first.]",
"challengeStoryDesc512":"My Lord, the patients are puking all over the place today.",
"challengeStoryDesc513":"What's up with this Imperial Doctor? Is he really as capable as he says?",
"challengeStoryDesc514":"[Zhang Guangyang happens to arrive right this moment. He is enraged:] `Who are you calling incapable? I'm the Imperial Doctor of the Court!`",
"challengeStoryDesc515":"Mr. Su, quiet!",
"challengeStoryDesc516":"Lord Zhang, the townspeople are vomiting a lot today. Please come have a look.",
"challengeStoryDesc517":"[Zhang Guangyang does not even spare you a glance.] `You'll just have to brew more of the antidote, multiplying the doses.`",
"challengeStoryDesc518":"You must have been stingy and didn't give them as much medicine as you should have. That must be why.",
"challengeStoryDesc519":"You...",
"challengeStoryDesc520":"[Though the Imperial Doctor is sent by the Court to cure the townspeople, he's never around when you need him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc521":"This Imperial Doctor doesn't care about the townspeople at all. Instead, he's outside having fun all the time. Seems quite suspicious to me.",
"challengeStoryDesc522":"Follow him in secret, then, and see where he goes every day.",
"challengeStoryDesc523":"[At his moment, Shan Ji arrives at your mansion and asks to see you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc524":"Brother, my soldiers had some of the antidote sent from the Court, yet they don't seem to have gotten any better.",
"challengeStoryDesc525":"Same here, bro!",
"challengeStoryDesc526":"Where's that Zhang Guangyang? We should ask him to come to our barracks to check on the soldiers.",
"challengeStoryDesc527":"I have no idea where he's gone either. He's never home, it seems.",
"challengeStoryDesc528":"[Zhang Guangyang is surprisingly careful in covering his tracks. Even Su Qi'er, tracker extraordinaire, loses him halfway.]",
"challengeStoryDesc529":"[On Su Qi'er's way back to the mansion, he runs into the salt merchant's daughter, who has already fully recovered.]",
"challengeStoryDesc530":"Excuse me, lady, are you the daughter of the salt merchant?",
"challengeStoryDesc531":"[Salt merchant's daughter: `Yes, that's me!`]",
"challengeStoryDesc532":"I heard that you were down with malaria. And you've recovered so quickly?",
"challengeStoryDesc533":"[Salt merchant's daughter: `Yes. My daddy paid the Imperial Doctor from the Imperial City to come see me, and I got well in no time! His skills are amazing indeed!]",
"challengeStoryDesc534":"Wow, really?",
"challengeStoryDesc535":"[After hearing what the salt merchant's daughter has to say, Su Qi'er bids her goodday and speeds back to the mansion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc536":"My Lord, I ran into the salt merchant's daughter on the street just now.",
"challengeStoryDesc537":"Oh, really? Isn't she down with malaria too?",
"challengeStoryDesc538":"[Su Qi'er repeats what he heard from the sat merchant's daughter to you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc539":"What is this Zhang Guangyang even up to?",
"challengeStoryDesc540":"What a swindler!",
"challengeStoryDesc541":"[You begin to become suspicious of the antidote sent from the Court.]",
"challengeStoryDesc542":"Yuan Fang, please get Tan Yan (the local doctor) for me!",
"challengeStoryDesc543":"[Once Tan Yan sees the antidote sent from the Court, he says: `These are just normal herbs! It's not Imperial Antidote, whatever that is.`]",
"challengeStoryDesc544":"Doc Tan, are you really sure?",
"challengeStoryDesc545":"[Doctor Tan inspects the antidote again, and concludes that it is indeed nothing but plain herbs with a moderate cooling effect.]",
"challengeStoryDesc546":"What's that Imperial Doctor doing, lying to the people like this? Does he have no regard for the lives of the civilians?",
"challengeStoryDesc547":"I'll kill him now!",
"challengeStoryDesc548":"Wait, brother! I bet he must have exchanged the antidote with something else.",
"challengeStoryDesc549":"No wonder Zhang Guangyang volunteered to go himself when I offered to go into the Imperial City to ask for medication.",
"challengeStoryDesc550":"It's my fault for being careless.",
"challengeStoryDesc551":"We need to figure out where the real Imperial Antidote went. Let's keep a low profile now—don't want the doctor to figure out what we're up to.",
"challengeStoryDesc552":"Not long ago, I saw Zhang Guangyang emerging from Blossom Tavern. Perhaps he...",
"challengeStoryDesc553":"That's unforgivable. The people are in turmoil, yet he's out there enjoying himself!",
"challengeStoryDesc554":"[You decide to station one of your men at Blossom Tavern.]",
"challengeStoryDesc555":"Mr. Ji, please hang out in Blossom Tavern and pretend to be a guest there!",
"challengeStoryDesc556":"[Not long after, Ji Xiaolan spots Zhang Guangyang in Blossom Tavern.]",
"challengeStoryDesc557":"[Zhang is speaking to a guest who is dressed in extravagant robes.]",
"challengeStoryDesc558":"[Ji Xiaolan calls over Lady Hua, hostess of Blossom Tavern.]",
"challengeStoryDesc559":"Dear Lady, you know who that expensive-looking man is?",
"challengeStoryDesc560":"Aw, you don't know? You clearly need to get out more! That's the renowned Li Laocai, Rank 6 Minister of Peace!",
"challengeStoryDesc561":"[Ji Xiaolan stuffs some coins into Lady Hua's hand and asks her to listen in on the conversation between Zhang and Li, requesting that she keeps all of this a secret.]",
"challengeStoryDesc562":"[Lady Hua takes the coins happily, and carries out her eavesdropping mission while pretending to pour tea for the guests.]",
"challengeStoryDesc563":"Sir, the two of them are talking in whispers, but luckily I have sensitive hearing!",
"challengeStoryDesc564":"Oh? Tell me everything!",
"challengeStoryDesc565":"Li Laocai said something about sending the Imperial Antidote to Banyan Town for Zhang Guangyang.",
"challengeStoryDesc566":"He also mentioned something about splitting the profits...",
"challengeStoryDesc567":"[Ji Xiaolan leaves Blossom Tavern swiftly and relays everything he found out to you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc568":"This dastardly doctor! He really has no regard of the well-being of the townspeople. Mr. Su, go retrieve that Imperial Antidote now!",
"challengeStoryDesc569":"Wait! Banyan Town is hundreds of miles away from here. Even if he manages to find the Imperial Antidote, the civilians will all be dead already.",
"challengeStoryDesc570":"What should we do then?",
"challengeStoryDesc571":"[Everyone is extremely worried, seeing that the condition of the civilians has taken a turn for the worse.]",
"challengeStoryDesc572":"My Lord, I may have an idea!",
"challengeStoryDesc573":"Oh? Out with it then!",
"challengeStoryDesc574":"Let's ask the Court for more of the Imperial Antidote—it's hard to come by, after all, so they'll understand. Zhang Guangyang will be in charge of shipping the antidote again, and we'll have the opportunity to catch him red-handed.",
"challengeStoryDesc575":"What a great idea, Mr. Ji!",
"challengeStoryDesc576":"Our people are in dire need of medication. We must send someone to the Imperial City right away.",
"challengeStoryDesc577":"[You tell Zhang Guangyang that you would need more of the antidote, and asks him to go to the Imperial City for more.]",
"challengeStoryDesc578":"You sure use up the medicine fast. Worry not, I'll head back to the Imperial City and bring back some more.",
"challengeStoryDesc579":"[You send Su Qi'er to follow Zhang Guangyang in secret as he sets off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc580":"[As expected, Zhang Guangyang dwells a bit longer than he should in a tavern on his way back.]",
"challengeStoryDesc581":"[Su Qi'er takes his fastest horse and rushes back to report the news. You and your men immediately set off towards the tavern.]",
"challengeStoryDesc582":"[Zhang Guangyang asks the tavern tender to swap the bags of Imperial Antidote with plain herbs and ship the real Imperial Antidote elsewhere.]",
"challengeStoryDesc583":"[You arrive right in time to witness the Imperial Antidote being shipped, and take the antidote into your possession.]",
"challengeStoryDesc584":"[You pretend that you're dining at the tavern and happen to run into Zhang Guangyang.] `Ah, Lord Zhang! You're finally back!`",
"challengeStoryDesc585":"[Seeing you so close to the crime scene, Zhang Guangyang is terrified out of his wits.]",
"challengeStoryDesc586":"[He keeps up a calm facade nevertheless, and points at the bags of swapped herbs.] `Yes, yes. It's been a long journey, but I've finally got the Imperial Antidote you asked for!`",
"challengeStoryDesc587":"Boys, inspect this Imperial Antidote!",
"challengeStoryDesc588":"[Your men inspect the bags carefully.] `My Lord, this isn't the Imperial Antidote!`",
"challengeStoryDesc589":"The nerve! Zhang Guangyang, as an Imperial Doctor of the Court, you ignored the needs of the people and swapped the antidote that could save their lives with something else. Own up to your crimes!",
"challengeStoryDesc590":"Mr. Su, take him!",
"challengeStoryDesc591":"[Zhang Guangyang tries to make excuses, but shuts up when you bring his accomplice you've captured to him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc592":"[At a distance, the butler of the Minister of Peace watches all of this go down.]",
"challengeStoryDesc593":"[Li Laocai is a man of discretion, and has sent his butler to follow the process of the Imperial Antidote transportation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc594":"[You return to town and insist that Zhang Guangyang brew the Imperial Antidote. After he is done, you throw him into prison.]",
"challengeStoryDesc595":"[In three days, the patients have gradually recovered.]",
"challengeStoryDesc596":"Insolent devil, own up. Tell us all about your accomplices in this abominable matter.",
"challengeStoryDesc597":"I have no accomplices. Do anything you want to me—no one else is involved!",
"challengeStoryDesc598":"Ooh, you're quite stubborn, huh?",
"challengeStoryDesc599":"Stop, please stop! I know I've sinned! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!",
"challengeStoryDesc600":"Don't worry, I won't execute you just yet. We still need to find out who's behind all this!",
"challengeStoryDesc601":"[The butler of the Minister of Peace has returned to the mansion of Li Laocai (Minister of Peace, Rank 6) and reported to him what he saw.]",
"challengeStoryDesc602":"Useless! All he needed to do was ship something, yet he couldn't even do it right!",
"challengeStoryDesc603":"Butler, we can't let Zhang Guangyang tell them everything, or I'll be in serious trouble. Send someone to assassinate him in prison.",
"challengeStoryDesc604":"Yes, Sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc605":"[In the dead of a moonless night, the assassin makes his move.]",
"challengeStoryDesc606":"[You have anticipated that this might happen, and have already moved Zhang Guangyang to Shan Ji's barracks beforehand.]",
"challengeStoryDesc607":"[After sneaking into the prison, the assassin sees the Imperial Doctor's butler and places his sword on the poor man's neck.] `Where's your Master?`",
"challengeStoryDesc608":"Please, I'm sorry, I don't know where he is either! Please let me go!",
"challengeStoryDesc609":"[When you hear the commotion, you surround the prison immediately.]",
"challengeStoryDesc610":"Who's there? Who dares break into prison?",
"challengeStoryDesc611":"You want to capture me? I'd like to see you try!",
"challengeStoryDesc612":"You think you can escape? I'd like to see YOU try!",
"challengeStoryDesc613":"[Zhang Guangyang refuses to give the name of his accomplices no matter how you torture him. You decide to switch target to the assassin you captured instead.]",
"challengeStoryDesc614":"Say it. Who is behind?",
"challengeStoryDesc615":"I'd rather die than tell you!",
"challengeStoryDesc616":"Ooh, you're an obstinate one, aren't you?",
"challengeStoryDesc617":"Just tell us who sent you, and we'll spare you. How about that?",
"challengeStoryDesc618":"I'm not afraid of death!",
"challengeStoryDesc619":"Boys, flog him first, then dismember him!",
"challengeStoryDesc620":"There's no point in leaving him around. Might as well just execute him.",
"challengeStoryDesc621":"[You pretend to agree with Su Qi'er's suggestion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc622":"[The assassin is terrified when he hears that he is to be dismembered, and even more terrified when he sees that everyone seems to be fine with it.]",
"challengeStoryDesc623":"My Lord, my Lord, please spare poor little me! I didn't do anything! Let me live!",
"challengeStoryDesc624":"I'll speak, I'll speak. I'll tell you everything.",
"challengeStoryDesc625":"[It turns out that the assassin is actually quite a coward. In the end, he admits that he was sent by Li Laocai.]",
"challengeStoryDesc626":"[Meanwhile, good news has also arrived from Shan Ji's troops.]",
"challengeStoryDesc627":"[Zhang Guangyang, unable to withstand the torment in the prison any longer, finally reveals the whereabouts of the Imperial Antidote.]",
"challengeStoryDesc628":"Great. We have all the evidence we need now. It's time to capture Li Laocai!",
"challengeStoryDesc629":"We'll need to find where he's hidden the Imperial Antidote first.",
"challengeStoryDesc630":"Brother, I know where the Imperial Antidote went!",
"challengeStoryDesc631":"[You learn that the tenth of every month is market day in Banyan Town. Merchants from around the country will meet there to purchase high-quality medical materials.]",
"challengeStoryDesc632":"The tenth? Isn't that the day after tomorrow?",
"challengeStoryDesc633":"Everyone, get ready! Let's set out right away!",
"challengeStoryDesc634":"I'll rally my troops as well.",
"challengeStoryDesc635":"Thanks, brother!",
"challengeStoryDesc636":"[Li Laocai believes that the assassin has already killed Zhang Guangyang, and he will have nothing to worry about anymore. Still, to be safe, he decides to sell all the Imperial Antidote he has on market day.]",
"challengeStoryDesc637":"[You and your men disguise yourselves as merchants, and arrive a day before market day at Banyan Town.]",
"challengeStoryDesc638":"[As expected, the market is bursting at the seams with people since early morning.]",
"challengeStoryDesc639":"[Ji Xiaolan spots the butler of the Minister of Peace in just a glance and nudges you.] `My Lord, that's the butler of the Minister of Peace.`",
"challengeStoryDesc640":"[Yuan Fang, pretending to be an interested buyer, trudges over.] `Ooh, is this the Imperial Antidote?`",
"challengeStoryDesc641":"That's correct, kind customer! It's Imperial Antidote straight from the Court gardens!",
"challengeStoryDesc642":"[After confirming that it is indeed Imperial Antidote, Yuan Fang says:] `I'll take them all!`",
"challengeStoryDesc643":"[Li Lao Cai's butler is shocked. He immediately sends someone to fetch his master.]",
"challengeStoryDesc644":"Do you even know how expensive these are?",
"challengeStoryDesc645":"So this Imperial Antidote is all yours? Well, I'll have them all!",
"challengeStoryDesc646":"[Seeing that Yuan Fang seems quite confident in his financial situation, Li Laocai replies,] `Yes, it's mine. All mine!`",
"challengeStoryDesc647":"You and your men seize the opportunity to show yourselves.",
"challengeStoryDesc648":"The audacity! Li Laocai, you, a Minister of Peace, dared to smuggle Imperial Antidote with the aid of the Imperial Doctor. We've caught you red-handed. Boys, take him in!",
"challengeStoryDesc649":"[Li Laocai tries to argue his way out of it, but promptly closes his mouth when you bring Zhang Guangyang in front of him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc650":"Ah, Li Laocai! I was loyal—I tried so hard to keep you out of this! Yet you sent someone to assassinate me! I'm disappointed. We'll meet at Court.",
"challengeStoryDesc651":"[Li Laocai is unable to defend himself at all during his trial, for there is ample evidence and also several witnesses testifying against him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc652":"[The civilians listening outside the door all cheer. They hold you in even higher reverence now.]",
"challengeStoryDesc653":"[Spring has barely arrived when news of the Emperor's visit of the southern areas reaches you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc654":"[Many Court officials have heard about you and what you've done for the townspeople. Prince Baylor, too, has had his eyes on you for a while.]",
"challengeStoryDesc655":"[Therefore, Prince Baylor asks for you to be his personal guide during his own secret tour of the southern areas.]",
"challengeStoryDesc656":"Congratulations, my Lord! The Court loves you now!",
"challengeStoryDesc657":"We're serving the right person indeed, my Lord!",
"challengeStoryDesc658":"Accompanying the Prince in his secret visit is a huge responsibility. I'm not sure if I would be able to handle it.",
"challengeStoryDesc659":"You'll be fine, my Lord. And we'll be here for you if you need any plans or ideas.",
"challengeStoryDesc660":"[After receiving the secret order, you and your men set off to meet up with Prince Baylor in Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc661":"My Lord, please take care of yourself and come back safely!",
"challengeStoryDesc662":"Of course, Lynnie. I'm in good hands. Do take good care of my sister and the young ones here.",
"challengeStoryDesc663":"[Three days later, you meet up with Prince Baylor in Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc664":"I hope you didn't wait long, Your Majesty. We're late.",
"challengeStoryDesc665":"We'll be relying on you to ensure everything is in good order on the Emperor's route during his visit.",
"challengeStoryDesc666":"Also, the Emperor might be visiting the South sooner than expected. We must hurry and make sure everything's up to standards in the area.",
"challengeStoryDesc667":"Rest assured, Prince Baylor. We'll do our best to make sure everything's safe in the areas where the Emperor will be visiting.",
"challengeStoryDesc668":"I've heard a lot of good things about you these days, but it never hurts to be careful.",
"challengeStoryDesc669":"Thank you, Your Majesty, for your trust in me. I guarantee I will not disappoint you.",
"challengeStoryDesc670":"[You and your companions pass by an embroidery shop near the riverbank, and see a middle-aged lady working on a gigantic canvas of a knight hunting a tiger.]",
"challengeStoryDesc671":"[Prince Baylor falls in love with the embroidery immediately, and asks:] `How much does this cost?`",
"challengeStoryDesc672":"[The embroideress, with her head down and back towards you, continues to work on her canvas. She repeats:] `No matter how much you pay, I ain't selling this!`",
"challengeStoryDesc673":"Why not? Why is this not for sale?",
"challengeStoryDesc674":"Do you have any idea who we are?",
"challengeStoryDesc675":"[Su Qi'er is on the verge of leaking the fact that one of your party is the Prince, but you stop him in time.]",
"challengeStoryDesc676":"Su Qi'er, don't be reckless! We need to keep the route of this visit in the South a secret! ",
"challengeStoryDesc677":"Yes, Sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc678":"You're thoughtful indeed, my Lord.",
"challengeStoryDesc679":"[The embroideress comments from aside: `I won't sell this to even the Emperor himself, so why would I be selling it to you people?`]",
"challengeStoryDesc680":"[Prince Baylor looks slightly pissed off, but he knows he cannot reveal the fact that he is royalty then and there.]",
"challengeStoryDesc681":"Kind Lady, may I ask if someone has already laid claims on this canvas?",
"challengeStoryDesc682":"[The embroideress replies, `This is a birthday present for our Mayor, Lord Zhao's father!`]",
"challengeStoryDesc683":"[You and your companions head to a teahouse for refreshments and a nice view of the canals and peaceful town life.]",
"challengeStoryDesc684":"Any seats left upstairs?",
"challengeStoryDesc685":"[The tavern tender explains:] `The Mayor, Lord Zhao, has reserved the whole second floor for himself. No one is allowed to enter unless it's the Emperor.`",
"challengeStoryDesc686":"That Mayor again? Just how important does this Mayor think he is?",
"challengeStoryDesc687":"Lord Zhao is a household name in this town. He's got a nickname, Zhuang Dou.",
"challengeStoryDesc688":"Hmm? Why Zhuang Dou?",
"challengeStoryDesc689":"See, there was one time Lord Zhao was moving house. His men were carrying several wooden chests full of gold and silver, but the bottom of the chests fell away and the contents were scattered all over the ground. The accountant came rushing over with some rice containers to hold the treasures with—putting items in the containers is called `Zhuang Dou` in our language, you know? Those jewels filled up seven whole containers! That's how the Mayor got his nickname. ",
"challengeStoryDesc690":"[You and your companions are not sure whether to laugh or cry at the reason behind the nickname.]",
"challengeStoryDesc691":"If the Mayor owns enough jewels to fill up seven rice containers, he must be up to no good.",
"challengeStoryDesc692":"[You and your companions become interested in learning more about Zhuang Dou's background.]",
"challengeStoryDesc693":"Hey, can you tell us more about this Zhuang Dou?",
"challengeStoryDesc694":"[The tavern tender is only too happy to talk.]",
"challengeStoryDesc695":"Lord Zhao often makes rounds in town in casual clothing and visits townspeople. He covers all the nearby areas dutifully and regularly.",
"challengeStoryDesc696":"Oh? Sounds like he loves his people then.",
"challengeStoryDesc697":"Loves his people? Oh, please...",
"challengeStoryDesc698":"Sir, you must be new here.",
"challengeStoryDesc699":"Well, this is our first time here, that's true.",
"challengeStoryDesc700":"So that's why you don't know. This Zhuang Dou pretends to be a charitable official, yet during his visits in town all he does is demand money and resources from the townspeople.",
"challengeStoryDesc701":"Is that true?",
"challengeStoryDesc702":"He's good at finding the tiniest fault with his subordinates, and forcing them to give him silver to compensate.",
"challengeStoryDesc703":"[You and Prince Baylor exchange glances and chuckle.]",
"challengeStoryDesc704":"I'd sure like to meet him.",
"challengeStoryDesc705":"Not everyone has the privilege to meet him, though.",
"challengeStoryDesc706":"[On your way out, you hear some other customers having an animated discussion about Zhuang Dou as well.]",
"challengeStoryDesc707":"[I heard that Zhuang Dou went and stripped the Mayor of Kunshan County of his position!]",
"challengeStoryDesc708":"Kunshan County? Tender, you know anything about what happened there?",
"challengeStoryDesc709":"Sure I do! Zhuang Dou is one of the townspeople's favorite gossip topics, after all.",
"challengeStoryDesc710":"Tell us all about it then!",
"challengeStoryDesc711":"[One day, Zhuang Dou was at Kunshan County, arranging affairs related to the increased number of guards for the Emperor's visit to the South.]",
"challengeStoryDesc712":"The Mayor of Kunshan County was a hopeless drunkard. He dozed off on the podium when reviewing cases, and Zhuang Dou happened to be on the spot.",
"challengeStoryDesc713":"Zhuang Dou slapped the table in rage. Qian Hutu, the Kunshan Mayor, snapped awake and bowed again and again in terror when he saw Zhuang Dou.",
"challengeStoryDesc714":"Qian Hutu knew all about Zhuang Dou's love for jewels, and whispered to him: `My Lord, I've prepared a whole cart of treasures for you. They're outside on the carriage right now, and I'll send them to you right away.`",
"challengeStoryDesc715":"Zhuang Dou gladly accepted the bribe, but stripped Qian Hutu of his position anyway.",
"challengeStoryDesc716":"Quite crafty indeed—though he did punish a few useless officials.",
"challengeStoryDesc717":"No matter what, though, he did take bribery. That's a crime in itself. He should be punished for that.",
"challengeStoryDesc718":"[The tavern tender, overhearing your conversation, assumes that you and your companions are not common civilians.]",
"challengeStoryDesc719":"Excuse me, Sirs, where do you hail from? And why do you think you'd be able to punish Zhuang Dou?",
"challengeStoryDesc720":"This Zhuang Dou is no easy target!",
"challengeStoryDesc721":"[The tavern tender continues:] `Zhuang Dou's father was once the tutor of the Emperor when he was little.`",
"challengeStoryDesc722":"Oh, you mean Zhao An?",
"challengeStoryDesc723":"Shh, Pri—[You almost let slip that Prince Baylor is among you, but luckily you caught yourself in time.]",
"challengeStoryDesc724":"Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Pang Jian, known as the Third Lord by many.",
"challengeStoryDesc725":"I see, I see!",
"challengeStoryDesc726":"So, Third Lord, you've heard of this Zhao An?",
"challengeStoryDesc727":"Yes, I have.",
"challengeStoryDesc728":"[Before Prince Baylor can continue, the tavern tender interrupts again.]",
"challengeStoryDesc729":"The Emperor is very gracious to this Zhao An. Every time he visits this area, he'd treat the whole Zhao family to extravagant feasts.",
"challengeStoryDesc730":"He was once the Emperor's tutor, and also has connections with the royal troops. That's why no one dares go against the Zhao family here.",
"challengeStoryDesc731":"With such an influential background, this family is indeed hard to properly deal with.",
"challengeStoryDesc732":"Perhaps the current Emperor is gullible? That's why he doesn't realize what's going on with Zhuang Dou and his family.",
"challengeStoryDesc733":"Su Qi'er, what impudence!",
"challengeStoryDesc734":"His Majesty is just and impartial—definitely not gullible. It's likely that some of the royal family members who have ties with the Zhao family distracted the Emperor so that he would overlook Zhuang Dou's crimes.",
"challengeStoryDesc735":"[You and your companions realize that you might have said a little bit too much in front of the tavern tender, so you quickly pay and take your leave.]",
"challengeStoryDesc736":"[Watching you disappear in the distance, the tavern tender mutters:] `Who do these outsiders think they are? How could they speak like that?`",
"challengeStoryDesc737":"[The townspeople have heard about the Emperor's scheduled visit, but no one has any idea the route he will take and when it will happen.]",
"challengeStoryDesc738":"[Zhuang Dou does not dare to extort people for money during this period, for fear that the Emperor will turn up any time. However, his desire for riches continues to be insatiable.]",
"challengeStoryDesc739":"When will the Emperor come? I'm so tired of this boring waiting!",
"challengeStoryDesc740":"My Lord, I have a fun suggestion. You interested?",
"challengeStoryDesc741":"Of course! Out with it!",
"challengeStoryDesc742":"None of the royal temples in our town are decent-looking enough. Let's build another one—not only will we be able to impress the Emperor when he arrives, but also you'd be able to profit... sounds good, huh?",
"challengeStoryDesc743":"Ha, I trained you well. Good idea, good idea!",
"challengeStoryDesc744":"I learned from only the best!",
"challengeStoryDesc745":"Butler, write up some posters to announce to the town: we Yangzhou locals are finally going to have a presentable royal temple!",
"challengeStoryDesc746":"[The announcement goes like this: To aid in the construction of a royal temple for the County, each household must contribute funds effort. In three days, officials and soldiers will be collecting the funds from each house.]",
"challengeStoryDesc747":"[The civilians aren't at all happy to see this announcement.]",
"challengeStoryDesc748":"[Many are discussing the situation with their neighbors. `We've had a terrible harvest this year. How would we have any money left to build a royal temple?`]",
"challengeStoryDesc749":"It's the orders from the Mayor. It will bring glory to the County! Each household must offer food and silver. Now that you've viewed the poster, get lost!",
"challengeStoryDesc750":"[You and your companions happen to pass by the gates and hear the civilians whining and complaining. You approach them to check out the situation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc751":"Wow, this Zhuang Dou! He's using the construction of a royal temple to exploit the people!",
"challengeStoryDesc752":"[Su Qi'er glares at the announcement and hollers:] `That scoundrel!`",
"challengeStoryDesc753":"Don't get your panties in a twist, everyone. This is the perfect opportunity to make a move!",
"challengeStoryDesc754":"[You all stare at Prince Baylor in confusion. Why is this the perfect opportunity?]",
"challengeStoryDesc755":"What do you mean by that, Third Lord?",
"challengeStoryDesc756":"We didn't have an excuse to arrest this Zhuang Dou, but now we do, don't we?",
"challengeStoryDesc757":"Ha, Prin—I mean, Third Lord, you sure do think ahead!",
"challengeStoryDesc758":"I'm impressed!",
"challengeStoryDesc759":"The announcement says that there will be officials and soldiers going around town collecting silver from each household. There's bound to be some families who have nothing to give.",
"challengeStoryDesc760":"I've heard that the crops of Jiangnan have been ravaged by insects this year. The harvest was terrible. The people would likely have no rations to turn in.",
"challengeStoryDesc761":"Let's head back to the inn now and discuss how to bring Zhuang Dou to justice.",
"challengeStoryDesc762":"Time is running out. Let's go!",
"challengeStoryDesc763":"[What you are most concerned about is that you don't own your own soldiers and may be outnumbered by Zhuang Dou's men.]",
"challengeStoryDesc764":"They say that even the most powerful dragon would have trouble defeating a snake with local reinforcements. I may be able to arrest Zhuang Dou for his crimes, but he has the support from many powerful forces in the area. If they all show up to help him, we'll be in trouble.",
"challengeStoryDesc765":"We should send for some of our troops, then.",
"challengeStoryDesc766":"My Lord, Shan Ji's barracks are not too far from here. I'll send him a message by pigeon post, and his men will be here in no time.",
"challengeStoryDesc767":"That's true, almost forgot about Sir Shan.",
"challengeStoryDesc768":"This Shan Ji—is he trustworthy?",
"challengeStoryDesc769":"I'd trust him with his life. He's perfect for this role.",
"challengeStoryDesc770":"Don't forget that this is a secret operation. We must not give away our identities.",
"challengeStoryDesc771":"Rest assured, Prince Baylor. I'll tell Shan Ji to dress up as a merchant on his way.",
"challengeStoryDesc772":"We're running out of time. Send the message now.",
"challengeStoryDesc773":"Yes, Your Majesty!",
"challengeStoryDesc774":"[The pigeon post reaches Shan Ji's barracks very soon, and Shan Ji sets off on an overnight journey to Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc775":"[As anticipated, Zhuang Dou and his men start collecting silver from every house three days later.]",
"challengeStoryDesc776":"[You and your companions have also arrived on the streets since morning, watching everything that is going down.]",
"challengeStoryDesc777":"[As expected, many townspeople have no food to offer. Some of them are kneeling on the ground, begging for forgiveness.]",
"challengeStoryDesc778":"Isn't this town usually very prosperous? How is it possible that none of you have silver? I bet you must be hiding them.",
"challengeStoryDesc779":"Everyone, search the houses! Take everything of value!",
"challengeStoryDesc780":"Don't you dare! Zhuang Dou, you're a Court official, yet you are tormenting your people like this. I'll bring you to justice on behalf of the Court now.",
"challengeStoryDesc781":"Ha, interesting! This is the first time anyone's said that to me. If anyone is going to Court, it's definitely you, not me!",
"challengeStoryDesc782":"Boys, get 'em!",
"challengeStoryDesc783":"[Shan Ji and his troops arrive in the nick of time.]",
"challengeStoryDesc784":"Soldiers! Protect the Lords, and capture Zhuang Dou alive!",
